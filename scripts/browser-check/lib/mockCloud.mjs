// Installs an in-page mock Supabase backend before the real app boots, for
// browser-check scripts that need to exercise the Community module.
//
// Why this exists: cloud-config.js points at the real, live production
// Supabase project (see docs/community/ and the module's own build notes) —
// it is the app's actual backend, with real member data on it. There is no
// local Supabase available in this environment either. Driving challenge
// creates, RSVPs, coach-tools writes, etc. against production from an
// unattended CI browser run is not something this repo does, ever — a
// single script bug could write real garbage into a real club's data.
//
// So this reuses test/helpers/mockSupabase.mjs — the exact same in-memory,
// RLS-faithful mock every node integration test boots cloud.js against —
// but evaluates it inside a real Chromium page instead of jsdom, using the
// same technique test/helpers/boot.mjs's bootCommunity() uses: replace
// window.supabase.createClient with a factory that returns the mock client,
// before cloud.js's own top-level `window.supabase.createClient(...)` call
// runs. The only new problem a real browser adds is that the real
// vendor/supabase.js bundle would otherwise overwrite window.supabase right
// after our init script sets it (script tag order: vendor/supabase.js loads
// before cloud.js in index.html) — solved below by serving a no-op in its
// place instead of trying to race it.

// Live bug hunt (2026-09-11): a round-7 agent testing interrupted async
// operations found that once the real service worker (sw.js) is installed
// and controlling a page, a page.reload() can have its ./vendor/supabase.js
// request served from the SW'S OWN cache rather than by the page.route()
// stub below - route interception attaches to the page's network layer, and
// a Service Worker satisfying a fetch from its own Cache Storage does not
// reliably go through the same layer. Confirmed: window.supabase.createClient
// visibly became the REAL factory after such a reload. No request to
// *.supabase.co was ever observed firing (the blanket route(/supabase\.co/)
// abort below is a second, independent net and held throughout), so this
// was not a confirmed production leak - but any script that calls
// page.reload() after a service worker has activated should pass
// `serviceWorkers: "block"` to browser.newPage()/newContext() to remove the
// bypass vector entirely. Not defaulted here: scripts/browser-check/
// update-flow.mjs deliberately exercises the REAL service-worker
