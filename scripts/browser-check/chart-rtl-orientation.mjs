// The progress chart runs right-to-left, asserted on painted pixels.
//
// THE BUG (8afbc57). renderChart() placed point i at `padX + i * step`:
// oldest at the left edge, newest at the right, inside a page that is
// `dir="rtl"` from <html> down. A Hebrew reader starts at the RIGHT, so
// they read the line newest-to-oldest, and a member whose lifts had been
// climbing for six weeks saw a line falling away in front of them. Every
// progress chart in the app meant the opposite of what its data said, for
// its entire audience. A design review caught it; not one persona did,
// which is the point — a chart that is upside down is not visibly broken,
// it is just wrong, and it is wrong about the single thing a member opens
// the history tab to find out.
//
// The fix mirrors x (`w - padX - i * step`), mirrors the date labels'
// rotation and anchor with it, and flips the wide-chart scroll box to
// dir="ltr" so it still opens on the newest end.
//
// WHY THIS FILE HAS TO EXIST. Nothing asserts any of it. There are two
// chart test files — test/wod-history-chart.test.mjs and
// test/chart-accessible-name.test.mjs — and neither looks at x at all; the
// second deliberately covers the aria-label, which is the one part of the
// chart that carries no direction. The commit message records the
// measurement that proved the fix ("oldest 01.09 sits at cx=276 and newest
// 07.09 at cx=24") and that measurement was taken by hand, once. Reverting
// the mirror today breaks no test in the repo.
//
// This is measured in Chromium rather than asserted on cx attributes,
// because cx is not where the point lands: the SVG is scaled by its
// viewBox against a percentage width, and the wide variant sits in a
// horizontally scrolling box with its own direction. Painted rects are the
// thing a member's eye actually receives.
//
// Usage:
//   node chart-rtl-orientation.mjs                 # local working tree
//   TARGET_URL=<url> node chart-rtl-orientation.mjs # a deployed site
