// Every Edge Function in this repo must actually exist on the live project.
//
// THE INCIDENT THIS CLOSES (2026-09-08). Two of the three functions in
// supabase/functions/ had never been deployed:
//
//   * purge_abandoned_profiles - the 03:31 UTC cron job POSTed to it nightly
//     and got 404 every time. cron.job_run_details recorded 'succeeded',
//     because the SQL that queues the request succeeds regardless of what
//     the request finds, so scheduled_job_health() called the job healthy
//     for as long as it had been broken.
//   * admin_reset_password - called from the browser by a real admin
//     session. A live user-facing 404, and structurally invisible to the job
//     health check, which only knows about cron jobs.
//
// Both were found by chasing an unrelated question. Nothing was watching.
//
// WHY THIS NEEDS NO SECRET, which is the point. The functions are deployed
// with verify_jwt = true, so the gateway answers before any function body
// runs, and the two answers are distinguishable with a key that is already
// public in cloud-config.js and shipped to every browser:
//
//     401 / 403  -> the function EXISTS and refused the caller  (PASS)
//     404        -> the route does not exist: NOT DEPLOYED      (FAIL)
//
// So this runs on every push, in an untrusted context, with no credential
// that could leak. It deliberately proves existence and nothing else - it
// does not prove the function works, and must never be read that way.
