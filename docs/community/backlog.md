# Community backlog and phase board

Single source of truth for what each agent works next. planner owns this file.
Agents work only tickets assigned to them in the current phase. Full ticket
files live in `docs/community/tickets/`.

## Legend

- Status: `todo`, `in-progress`, `review`, `done`, `parked`
- `parked` means blocked on the attendance data-source decision
- `partial` in a ticket file means part of the scope ships now, part is parked

## Current phase

Phase 1 Community V1.

Phase 0 status: pushed on branch `community/phase-0`, commit 3977b85. CI:
node-tests pass, browser-checks pass, migration-check applied all 13
migrations against a real Postgres with no error. Schema is validated.
Phase 1 proceeds.

Note (2026-09-02, re-verified as part of COMM-332): the paragraph above is
Phase-0-era and stale on one point — it is kept as historical record, not
updated in place, but this note corrects it. `.github/workflows/test.yml`'s
`migration-check` job has never actually carried `continue-on-error` on the
`supabase test db` step; it is a hard gate today, same as always. A prior
same-day audit pass reported 68/1995 pgTAP failures, but that run was
against a Supabase stack that was already up rather than a fresh
`supabase start`/`db reset`, by its own admission. Re-run clean (`supabase
db reset` against all 76 current migrations, then `supabase test db`):
`Files=56, Tests=1995 ... Result: PASS`, zero failures. The gate is green;
treat the 68-failure count as a stale-environment artifact, not a real
regression to chase.

Note (2026-09-03): the "Phase 1 Community V1" heading above is stale in the
same way the paragraph below it already was — kept as historical record,
not rewritten. Phases 1, 2, and 3 are all filed and largely shipped (see
their own sections below); Phase 4, Registration & invite management, is
now also filed, from a direct product-owner ask rather than a spec
section. See "## Phase 4 tickets, Registration & invite management" below.

Note (2026-09-04): Phase 4 is closed out — COMM-381's QA sweep confirmed
every Phase 4 ticket done and all three CI jobs green from a fresh state.
See "## Phase 4 tickets, Registration & invite management" below, COMM-381's
own summary paragraph, for what it found and fixed.

Note (2026-09-15): **the board's statuses were stale and have been
reconciled against the code.** Before this pass it read 38 `todo`, 29
`review`, 7 `partial`, 86 `done` — while the features those `todo` rows
describe (the composer, ranked feed, reactions, two-level comment threads,
the moderation queue, the notification centre) have all been shipped for
weeks and were exercised live, in a real browser and against real Postgres,
by the twenty-round bug-and-security hunt that closed on 2026-09-12. A board
that reports half a shipped module as not started is worse than no board, so
it was corrected rather than left as history.

**Method, so the flip is auditable and not just asserted.** Every row with a
non-`done` status was checked for two independent kinds of evidence: its
ticket ID cited in implementation (`cloud.js`/`app.js`/`index.html`/`sw.js`)
or in a migration, and its ticket ID cited in a test (`test/*.mjs`,
`supabase/tests/*.sql`, `scripts/browser-check/*.mjs`). 67 rows carried both
and were flipped to `done`. Six rows cited no ticket ID anywhere and were
resolved by looking at the feature directly instead of trusting the ID
convention — COMM-106 and COMM-104 are `renderAchievementPostCard()` /
`renderWorkoutPostCard()`, both registered in `cloud.js`'s post-type dispatch
table; COMM-338's two halves are `supabase test db` in `test.yml`'s
`migration-check` job and `scripts/smoke-test-multi-role.mjs`. The `review`
status meaning "built, awaiting QA sign-off" is what most Phase-0/1 rows were
still carrying; the QA sign-off happened (COMM-381 for Phase 4, then twenty
hunt rounds across everything), so leaving them at `review` was a filing lag,
not a real hold.

**What is deliberately still not `done`, and why — these seven are the real
remaining list.** None was flipped, and none should be without new work:

| ID | Status | Why it stays |
|---|---|---|
| COMM-337 | `todo` | The only genuinely open ticket. Real clickjacking headers need the site off GitHub Pages (which cannot set response headers) or behind an edge layer. Mitigated, not closed: `frame-guard.js` ships a client-side frame-buster and `_headers` is staged for whichever host reads it. A hosting decision, not code. |
| COMM-329 | `partial` | Honestly partial: the shared paths are fixed (`renderTabHeader`, `adminAnalyticsCard()`'s `<h3>`), but ~40 one-off `.field-label` sub-headers across invites/challenges/events/recaps/profile are still plain `<div>`s. A file-wide audit, not a shared-function fix. |
| COMM-143 | `partial` | Notification types that depend on attendance stay parked with the attendance decision. |
| COMM-351, COMM-353, COMM-354 | `partial` | Cross-repo design-token reconciliation against `haimunia-app`, which is outside this workspace. **Unverifiable from here** — not claimed either way rather than guessed. |
| COMM-368 | `partial` | Same reason: extracting shared safety helpers into a package both repos consume needs the other repo. |

COMM-303 was left exactly as it was — its status cell already carries its own
qualifier ("storage and reader only; the derivation is NOT built"), which is
more informative than any single word, and overwriting that with `done` would
have destroyed real information.

## Phase 0 tickets

| ID | Title | Agent | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| COMM-000 | Convert spec P0 and P1 sections into tickets with acceptance criteria | planner | done |
| COMM-001 | Migration: post_type enum and posts columns (source_type, source_id, visibility, status, metadata) | schema | done |
| COMM-002 | Migration: post_media table, up to 4 rows per post, alt text column | schema | done |
| COMM-003 | Migration: feed_impressions and feed_interactions tables with RLS | schema | done |
| COMM-004 | Migration: achievement_definitions and member_achievements with RLS | schema | done |
| COMM-005 | Migration: notifications, notification_preferences, push_subscriptions | schema | done |
| COMM-006 | Migration: challenges, challenge_participants, challenge_progress, challenge_teams | schema | done |
| COMM-007 | Migration: events and event_attendees | schema | done |
| COMM-008 | Migration: roles, permissions, role_permissions, seed permission strings | schema | done |
| COMM-009 | Migration: admin_actions audit table | schema | done |
| COMM-010 | Migration: profile privacy columns and defaults | schema | done |
| COMM-011 | Migration: empty coach_engagement_flags table with RLS | schema | done |
| COMM-012 | Product event bus module and typed event list | platform | done |
| COMM-013 | Analytics event helper, analytics_events table, WCAM definition | platform | done |
| COMM-014 | Supabase Realtime harness and subscription helper | platform | done |
| COMM-015 | Client-side image resize and compress before upload | platform | done |
| COMM-016 | Required recovery method at invite redemption | identity-privacy | done |
| COMM-017 | Actor-level invite throttle outside the anonymous user ID | identity-privacy | done |
| COMM-018 | Privacy toggle model and RLS enforcement | identity-privacy | done |
| COMM-019 | One RLS test per new table (static assertion form) | qa | done |
| COMM-020 | pgTAP RLS enforcement suite, run by migration-check CI | qa | done |

Phase 0 exit: all three CI jobs green, no user-facing change until the bundle
deploys with COMM-016. Identity decision resolved, see the resolved questions
below.

COMM-012 to COMM-015 note: platform shipped four classic scripts under
`src/`, loaded by `index.html` before `cloud.js` and `app.js`, precached in
`sw.js`, and loaded in the same order by `test/helpers/boot.mjs`. Contracts
are in `docs/community/contracts.md` under "Client platform helpers". Phase
0 wires no producer, no consumer, no subscription and no upload to any of
them, so there is no user-facing change. Both follow-ups are closed by
COMM-170: it is the first `HaimuniaAnalytics.configure()` call, and it moved
the WCAM definition out of the `src/analytics.js` comment into
`docs/community/metrics.md`, which now also carries the event-to-surface
table. The module keeps a one-line pointer at the doc.

COMM-019 note: qa delivered static assertions that pin each policy, trigger,
and constraint so a widening edit fails CI. The JS mock cannot run Postgres,
so no boundary is observed denying a real cross-user query. COMM-020 adds that:
a pgTAP suite under `supabase/tests/` impersonating two auth users, run by the
existing `supabase start` CI job with one added `supabase test db` step.
Estimated one day. Recommended before the V1 release, since privacy and
moderation are RLS-enforced release criteria. Decision pending from the user
on whether it blocks Phase 0 exit or moves to a pre-V1 hardening slot.
qa consolidated the 22 per-table tests into one file, flagged for planner.

COMM-020 note: qa added `supabase/tests/`, a pgTAP suite the `migration-check`
job now runs with `supabase test db` after `supabase start`. One
`NNNN_slug_test.sql` per Phase 0 migration, plus `rls_helpers.sql` with the
fixture members, coach, admin, owner, a no-recovery member, and a
`set_auth(uuid)` shim that switches `role` and `request.jwt.claims` so
`auth.uid()` and `auth.role()` resolve to the chosen member for the rest of
the transaction.

Boundaries now under true two-user runtime enforcement, allow and deny both
asserted:

- 0001 clubs, roles, permissions, role_permissions: member reads, member
  writes denied, owner writes allowed. has_perm, is_staff, is_admin resolved
  per role.
- 0002 admin_actions: analytics-holder reads, member and coach denied, no
  client insert, update, or delete, log_admin_action not callable.
- 0003 profiles: self update cannot move is_admin, club_id, or
  recovery_verified_at, insert cannot stamp it, mark_recovery_verified
  refuses an unverified account. visible_to_club hides from other members
  not self or admin. allow_follows and block edges gate the follows insert.
  can_view_profile_field flips per toggle, raises on an unknown field, and a
  block edge short-circuits it. self is always true.
- 0004 workout_posts columns: default_post_type derivation, status default,
  widened source_type, recovery-gated insert.
- 0005 post visibility and media: full viewer matrix over club, friends,
  only_me, hidden, for author, mutual follow, one-way follower, stranger,
  blocked, and real admin. post_media position bound, uniqueness, author-uid
  path trigger, parent-visibility read, non-author and removed-post insert
  denial. add_post_comment and toggle_reaction recovery gate, with
  reaction-remove still working.
- 0006 feed telemetry: own-row read and insert on both tables, cross-member
  and admin read denied, no update path, feed_record_impressions 20 ok,
  51 raises, repeated batch de-duped.
- 0007 achievements: member reads definitions, admin writes, four attendance
  seeds present and disabled. member_achievements own-read, club-visible
  read gated by show_achievements and block edge, no self-award, second
  non-repeatable row hits the partial unique index.
- 0008 notifications: own-row read, no client insert, update reaches
  read_at only. notification_preferences and push_subscriptions own-row.
- 0009 challenges: draft visibility, member cannot create, teams read with
  parent and write by permission, participant self-join only on an active
  challenge with recovery, no editing another participant, progress append
  only for an active participant.
- 0010 events: draft visibility, member cannot create, RSVP self and
  published and recovery, capacity trigger on the direct upsert with
  going to going still allowed, show_in_attendee_lists hides an attendee
  from members but not self or an event manager.
- 0011 coach_engagement_flags: the flagged member never reads their own row
  as a plain member, as a coach, or as an admin. Staff read and write rows
  about others. A plain non-staff member reads nothing.
- 0012 analytics_events: own or null insert, cross-member insert denied,
  the writer cannot read back, non-holder denied, analytics-holder reads,
  4 KB props trigger, no update or delete.
- 0013 invite_attempts: table unreachable, bump not callable, throttle
  survives a session swap keyed on actor_key, a fresh actor is not
  pre-limited, same answer and increment for a new versus a guessing actor,
  an already-redeemed caller gets their role back and the function never
  raises.

Still static-assertion only, kept in test/community-rls-boundaries.test.mjs
as change-detectors, since they are facts about the SQL text rather than a
runtime boundary: exact grant and revoke lists, "no policy exists" phrased
as catalog absence, trigger binding names, the profiles protect trigger
living in 202608270003, seed row contents beyond counts,
coach_engagement_flags shipping empty (no producer), and the storage.objects
post-photo policies, which the pgTAP suite does not exercise because it
creates no storage objects.

Local validation: not possible. Docker is not on the authoring machine, so
`supabase test db` could not run. SQL was checked by hand and for balanced
quoting and structure only. CI is the first real run.

| COMM-125 | Block member effects | engagement | done |

### achievements

| ID | Title | Agent | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| COMM-130 | Achievement engine, non-attendance triggers | achievements | done |
| COMM-131 | Achievement definitions seed, non-attendance | achievements | done |
| COMM-132 | PR detection hook | achievements | done |
| COMM-133 | PR share prompt UI | achievements | done |
| COMM-134 | Achievement unlock celebration and optional share | achievements | done |

### notifications

| ID | Title | Agent | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| COMM-140 | Notification center | notifications | done |
| COMM-141 | Notification model read and mark-read wiring | notifications | done |
| COMM-142 | Immediate versus batched routing | notifications | done |
| COMM-143 | Phase 1 notifications wired | notifications | partial |
| COMM-144 | Notification preferences per type | notifications | done |

COMM-143 is `partial`: the client renders every Phase 1 type with the
right icon, category, copy and deep link, and the mock produces the rows.
The server trigger set that creates them is documented in
`docs/community/contracts.md` under "Needs from schema, notifications" and
is not built here. The one open item there, that a `post_comments` trigger
cannot see the client-only mention list, is closed by 202608280021: the
four-argument `add_post_comment` writes `comment_mentions` and the mention
notification hangs off an AFTER INSERT trigger on that table, not on
`post_comments`.

### admin-moderation

| ID | Title | Agent | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| COMM-150 | RBAC permission strings in the client | admin-moderation | done |
| COMM-151 | Report flow with reasons | admin-moderation | done |
| COMM-152 | Admin moderation queue | admin-moderation | done |
| COMM-153 | Moderation queue actions | admin-moderation | done |
| COMM-154 | Admin action audit writes | admin-moderation | done |
| COMM-155 | Pinned content | admin-moderation | done |
| COMM-156 | Expose the HEAD_COACH role | admin-moderation | done |

### coach-tools, platform, qa

| ID | Title | Agent | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| COMM-160 | Coach identity across the community | coach-tools | done |
| COMM-170 | Analytics events for Phase 1 surfaces | platform | done |
| COMM-190 | Phase 1 dialog keyboard and focus tests | qa | done |
| COMM-191 | Phase 1 coverage sweep and CI gate | qa | done |

Phase 1 release maps to spec section 94. Gate is COMM-191.

## Phase 2 tickets, Engagement (spec V1.5)

ID range COMM-201 to COMM-234. Ticket files are in
`docs/community/tickets/`. Build order per
`2026-08-28-community-module-plan.md`: challenges, then events, then
announcement priority/recap/onboarding, then the coach dashboard, then
realtime, then search/following/directory, then web push, then analytics,
then the QA sweep. Every ticket in this phase respects the three
2026-08-30 resolutions: attendance stays out (COMM-205, COMM-210, COMM-232
are explicitly non-attendance and stay that way until their named Phase 3
successor), no "Message" affordance exists anywhere (COMM-224, COMM-230,
COMM-231, COMM-229 each say so explicitly), and web push (COMM-229)
proceeds with the iOS installed-PWA-only limitation accepted as scope, not
logged as a blocker.

### challenges

| ID | Title | Agent | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| COMM-201 | Challenge model generalization from the weekly challenge | challenges | done |
| COMM-202 | Individual target and individual performance challenges | challenges | done |
| COMM-203 | Cooperative challenge with club aggregate and contributors | challenges | done |
| COMM-204 | Team challenge with per-team totals | challenges | done |
| COMM-205 | Consistency challenge on non-attendance metrics | challenges | done |
| COMM-206 | Coach custom-rules challenge | challenges | done |
| COMM-207 | Challenge list, detail, join and leave | challenges | done |

COMM-201 to COMM-207 build on `challenges`, `challenge_teams`,
`challenge_participants`, `challenge_progress` from 202608280009 (COMM-006),
whose direct RLS grants already cover create, edit, join, and leave.
Everything schema owed this cluster shipped in 202608290003 through
202608290006: the `challenge_progress_view` composite type and `chal_progress`
body, the `challenge_progress_apply` trigger (running-total sync plus the
cooperative milestone post), the `chal_record_progress` coach-entry RPC, and
the `ending_soon_notified_at` column plus `chal_notify_ending_soon()` and its
two join/complete notification triggers (COMM-208). See "## Challenges" in
`docs/community/contracts.md` for every signature, and "Phase 2 schema
handoff for qa" below for the boundary table. No feature agent is blocked on
schema for this cluster.

### events

| ID | Title | Agent | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| COMM-213 | Events tables consumption, list and detail | events | done |
| COMM-214 | Event RSVP and capacity | events | done |
| COMM-215 | Event types and add to calendar | events | done |
| COMM-216 | Event comments | events | done |
| COMM-217 | Upcoming event card in the feed top area | events | done |

`events` and `event_attendees`, `event_rsvp`, and the capacity/deadline
trigger already shipped in 202608280010 (COMM-007). COMM-216 is a design
decision, not a schema change: event comments ride a companion `POST_EVENT`
post created at publish time, reusing `post_comments` end to end rather than
adding a polymorphic comment target. COMM-214's `notif_on_event_cancelled`
trigger shipped in 202608290009 with `supabase/tests/0029_event_cancelled_notification_test.sql`,
so no events ticket is schema-blocked; see "## Events" in
`docs/community/contracts.md`.

All five landed client-side in `cloud.js` against that shipped schema, no
migration: Upcoming/Past list and a create/edit form gated on
`community.event.manage` (COMM-213), RSVP through `event_rsvp()` with the
capacity/deadline errors surfaced on the detail dialog and the feed
top-area quick actions (COMM-214), nine typed badges plus a client-built
`.ics` download (COMM-215), the companion `POST_EVENT` post created at
first-publish via `post_create` and then promoted from its default
POST_TEXT shape by one own-row `posts_update_self` update - not a schema
change, see `ensureEventCompanionPost()`'s comment in `cloud.js` - with its
`post_comments` thread reusing `renderComments()`/`add_post_comment`
untouched (COMM-216), and the feed top-area card reading the same
`state.events` the Boards list loads (COMM-217). Also fixed as part of this
cluster: `resolveNotifTarget`'s `/feed` branch was shadowing `q.event`
before it could ever be checked, so an `event_cancelled` notification's
`/community/feed?event=<id>` link opened plain feed instead of the event -
the precedence now matches the existing `q.announcement` guard. The
COMM-228 search result's `open-event` action, previously a tracking-only
stub, now opens the real event detail. `test/community-events.test.mjs`
(20 tests) and one added assertion in `test/helpers/mockSupabase.mjs`'s
`event_rsvp` mock RPC (a faithful stand-in for the real function plus the
`enforce_event_capacity` trigger, needed for the capacity-race and
deadline tests) are the executing coverage; a real Add to Calendar click
degrades to the documented error message under jsdom's missing
Blob/URL.createObjectURL, so `buildEventIcs()` is tested directly and is
exported on `window` for that reason, same pattern as
`window.renderPostCard`.

### announcements and recaps

| ID | Title | Agent | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| COMM-218 | Announcement priority levels and expiry | admin-moderation | done |
| COMM-219 | Announcement notification toggle and urgent path | notifications | done |
| COMM-220 | Weekly member recap Edge Function | recaps | done |
| COMM-221 | Weekly recap surface and share | recaps | done |
| COMM-222 | New member onboarding sequence, non-attendance steps | recaps | done |

COMM-218 replaces the Phase 1 `important` boolean with a three-tier
`priority` and an `expires_at` column; `important` stays as a generated
mirror so no other Phase 1 trigger needs an edit beyond
`notif_is_operational`, which COMM-219 widens. See "Needs from schema,
admin-moderation (Phase 2)" and "Needs from schema, notifications (Phase 2)".
COMM-220 needs a new `weekly_recaps` table, COMM-222 a new
`onboarding_progress` table, both own-row RLS, see "Needs from schema,
recaps". COMM-222's steps tied to the member's first and third logged training day
(the columns are named `first_class_shown_at`/`third_class_shown_at`; the
clock is `attendance_log`, not a class roster — 202609060024) are not
built, carrying a TODO to COMM-P07 and COMM-316.

### coach-tools

| ID | Title | Agent | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| COMM-223 | Coach dashboard shell with Celebrate | coach-tools | done |
| COMM-224 | Coach Welcome section | coach-tools | done |
| COMM-225 | One-tap congratulate action | coach-tools | done |
| COMM-226 | Coach Engage section scaffold, hidden | coach-tools | done |

COMM-223 needs a new staff-only `coach_celebrate_feed` function. COMM-224
needs `profiles.assigned_coach_id` and a new `member_contact_log` table.
See "Needs from schema, coach-tools". COMM-226 ships the Engage section
hidden behind a default-off flag; `coach_engagement_flags` (COMM-011) stays
empty, unchanged from Phase 1, until COMM-304.

### realtime and search

| ID | Title | Agent | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| COMM-209 | Challenge realtime progress | platform | done |
| COMM-227 | Realtime for comments and reaction counts | platform | done |
| COMM-228 | Member, event, and challenge search | platform | done |
| COMM-210 | Consistency leaderboard mode, non-attendance | feed | done |
| COMM-211 | Progress leaderboard mode | feed | done |
| COMM-212 | Friends leaderboard mode and hide-my-result | feed | done |
| COMM-230 | Following system surface and states | engagement | done |
| COMM-231 | Members directory screen | engagement | done |
| COMM-232 | People you train with suggestions, non-attendance fallback | feed | done |

COMM-209, COMM-227 and COMM-228 are complete, both halves. Schema shipped in
202608290007 and 202608290008: `challenge_progress`,
`challenge_participants`, `post_comments`, `reactions`, and `notifications`
are in the `supabase_realtime` publication, and
`community_search(p_query, p_limit)` exists. The client half then landed in
`cloud.js`: five channels through `HaimuniaRealtime` (`chal-progress-<id>`,
`chal-participants-<id>`, `feed-comments`, `feed-reactions`, `notif-<uid>`),
each handler re-fetching through the surface's existing load path on a
400 ms debounce, torn down by `setCommunityTab`, `closeChallengeView` and
sign-out; plus the grouped members/events/challenges search UI on the
Account tab. The own-row notification subscription COMM-140 shipped as a
documented no-op is live, closing that gap. See "## Realtime and search" in
`docs/community/contracts.md` (moved there from "Needs from schema,
platform (Phase 2)", now closed) for both the schema and the client channel
inventory, the "Phase 2 schema handoff for qa" table below for boundaries,
and `test/community-realtime-and-search.test.mjs` for the executing
coverage. One gap this cluster deliberately left, for a follow-up ticket:
an event search result had nowhere to navigate until COMM-213 built the
event detail surface, so it recorded `EVENT_VIEWED` and rendered title,
start and status only - closed by the events cluster, whose `open-event`
action now opens the real detail dialog from that same search row.
COMM-210, COMM-211, COMM-212 and COMM-232 are now complete, both halves.
Schema shipped in 202608290015 (`leaderboard_row`, `feed_leaderboard`,
`people_suggestions`, `consistency_week_streaks`); the client half landed in
`cloud.js` as one fetch path and one row renderer shared by every board. See
"### Leaderboard and suggestions client contract" in
`docs/community/contracts.md` and
`test/community-leaderboards-and-suggestions.test.mjs` for the executing
coverage. Three decisions worth carrying forward:

- COMM-210's board replaced the old `community_streaks` strip on the Boards
  sub-tab rather than sitting beside it. Same figure, but ranked, tie-broken
  and privacy-filtered server-side, with the caller's own row always present.
  `loadStreaks()` / `state.streaks` stay, still read by the coach Welcome
  surface.
- COMM-211 swapped COMM-207's existing challenge-detail leaderboard panel off
  `chal_progress()`'s own `leaderboard` key and onto
  `feed_leaderboard(mode='progress', limit=20)`, which is what the ticket asked
  for and also closes a real gap: the old key applies neither `in_leaderboards`
  nor a stable tie-break. "The full board at 50" is the same panel re-asking,
  not a second screen. `chal_progress`'s key is untouched; the client just no
  longer reads it.
- COMM-232's strip was temporarily mounted on the Account sub-tab until the
  members directory existed to hold it. COMM-231 closes this: both
  `TODO(COMM-231)` markers left by this cluster are picked up -
  `renderPeopleSuggestions()` now renders only on the Directory sub-tab (moved,
  not duplicated), and COMM-212's friends-scope empty state now routes to the
  directory instead of the Account tab's bare search box.

COMM-230 and COMM-231 are now complete, both agreed to need no new contract
(no schema, no new RPC) and both delivered as such - a direct RLS read on
`follows` and a direct RLS cursor-paginated read on `profiles`. See
`test/community-following-surface.test.mjs` and
`test/community-members-directory.test.mjs` for the executing coverage. Two
decisions worth carrying forward:

- COMM-230's follower/following expand is only offered on the caller's own
  profile. `follows_visible` (202608260001) is `follower_id = auth.uid() or
  followed_id = auth.uid()` - a direct RLS read of another member's follower
  list would silently narrow to "the one edge that happens to also touch the
  caller", which is not that member's real follower list. Rather than render
  a list that is quietly wrong, another member's profile keeps the plain
  count (unchanged from pre-COMM-230) with no expand control. Enumerating a
  third party's real follower list would need a new definer RPC, out of this
  ticket's stated no-new-contract scope.
- COMM-231's directory reuses `community_search` (COMM-228) at its own
  2-character floor and falls back to a client-side filter over the
  already-loaded page below that, per the ticket's own "use your judgment"
  clause - documented at `directorySearch()` in `cloud.js`.

### web push, analytics, qa

| ID | Title | Agent | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| COMM-229 | Web push subscription and service worker handler, behind a flag | notifications | done |
| COMM-233 | Phase 2 analytics events | platform | done |
| COMM-234 | Phase 2 QA sweep and browser scenarios | qa | done |

COMM-229 wires subscription storage (the `push_subscriptions` table already
shipped in 202608280008, no schema change) and the `sw.js` client handler.
Actually sending a push needs a `notif_push_send` service-role Edge Function
or scheduled job, not built by this ticket, the same "storage exists,
delivery scheduler does not" gap already logged for the Phase 1 batch
flusher. COMM-233 lands last, once every surface it tracks exists. COMM-234
is the phase's merge gate, dependent on every other Phase 2 ticket.

COMM-229's client half landed behind `state.featureFlags.notifPush`, the
same localStorage-backed pattern `featureFlags.coachEngage` (COMM-226) set:
default off, so `NOTIF_PUSH_ENABLED`'s "off in production" requirement holds
without a separate constant to keep in sync. A device has exactly one
PushSubscription regardless of how many notification types route through
it, so subscribing happens once (the first type switched to Push) and every
later type switched to Push just upserts its own `notification_preferences`
row without re-prompting - verified in
`test/community-web-push.test.mjs`. A real VAPID keypair was generated for
this ticket (Node's `crypto.generateKeyPair('ec', {namedCurve:
'prime256v1'})`, no `web-push` dependency added); the public half lives in
`cloud-config.js` as `notifPushVapidPublicKey` since a VAPID public key is
meant to be exposed to the browser, and the private half was discarded
rather than committed anywhere - whoever builds `notif_push_send` needs a
real one provisioned as a Supabase Edge Function secret at that time, not
this demo one. An OS-level permission revoke (outside the app) can't be
detected from a live `PushSubscription` object - the browser simply
discards it, with no API to recover the dead endpoint - so the client also
keeps its own last-known endpoint in `localStorage` and reconciles
`revoked_at` against it the next time the device's push status is
checked; this is best-effort by nature (a device that never reopens the
app after a revoke leaves its row unrevoked until `notif_push_send`
eventually gets a real send failure back from the push service and can
mark it itself - not built here, out of scope per the ticket). The
`notificationclick` cold-start path (`sw.js` opening a fresh window, no
existing one to focus) round-trips through a `?notif=` query param
app.js captures at boot and hands to the community layer once its own
session is ready - not strictly required by the ticket's own wording, but
built anyway so "opens one at the deep link" is true end-to-end rather
than only for the already-open-window case.

COMM-233 found the three bridged names it was asked to confirm
(`challenge_joined`, `challenge_completed`, `event_rsvp`) already firing end
to end from COMM-207's and COMM-214's producers, with no wiring to add: the
Phase 1 bridge and its agreed prop shape were what those producers emitted
into, which is the payoff of `BUS_EVENT_MAP` having been settled before the
surfaces existed. Two naming decisions worth carrying: the ticket's
`recap_viewed` / `recap_shared` were wired as the already-reserved
`weekly_recap_opened` / `weekly_recap_shared` rather than minted as second
spellings, since a rename would split every recap query and the reserved
names had never fired; and the props allow-list discipline `BUS_PROP_KEYS`
gave bridged events now exists for hand-tracked ones too, as
`HAND_PROP_KEYS`, applied inside `track()`. It covers the Phase 2 names
only - retro-fitting it onto Phase 1 events would silently narrow rows
already in the table, which is what `SCHEMA_VERSION` exists to make visible.
WCAM was reviewed name by name rather than by default: viewing (leaderboard,
recap, search, roster) does not count, `coach_congratulate_sent` counts for
the coach because the row's `user_id` is the actor, and `push_opt_in` is
account configuration, not participation. One pre-existing mislabel went
with it: the Boards list cards carried no `data-source`, so every challenge
or event opened from the Boards sub-tab recorded `source: "post_card"` - a
source split across that fix is not comparable, noted in metrics.md rather
than backfilled.

**COMM-234, the Phase 2 QA sweep and merge gate, DONE.** Cross-referenced
every Phase 2 ticket's acceptance criteria against the existing suite,
closed the real gaps found, and re-verified all three CI jobs independently
rather than trusting any earlier agent's own report. `npm test`: 764 -> 769
(768 pass, 1 skip, 0 fail). `npx supabase test db`: 884 -> 940 assertions
across 2 new files, verified from a clean `supabase db reset` (all 43
migrations apply) exactly like `migration-check` runs it - this session had
a working local Docker Supabase stack, unlike earlier Phase 2 sessions.
`scripts/browser-check`: 10 -> 17 scripts, all green, including 7 new
Community scenarios.

Also found: the challenges cluster's own backlog rows (COMM-201-207) had
been sitting at `todo` this whole phase, never bumped to `review` when the
schema and client commits landed - a bookkeeping gap, not a build gap (the
tests were real and passing throughout). Promoted straight to `done` here
along with every other Phase 2 ticket this sweep confirms.

Real bug found and fixed, not just flagged: `renderConfirmDialog()`
concatenated `renderConfirmSheet()` FIRST, before `renderChallengeViewOverlay()`,
`renderEventViewOverlay()`, and `renderPostComposer()`. Every one of those
overlays shares the same `.modal-overlay` class and the same fixed
`z-index:50` (index.html), so two open at once stack by DOM order, not by
which one is logically on top - and `askConfirm()` is always a
modal-on-modal nested inside whatever triggered it (leave-challenge fires it
with challengeView still open, event-cancel with eventView still open,
composer-discard with the post composer still open). In a real browser the
confirm button was rendered but visually unreachable, pointer-events
intercepted by the still-open parent dialog. No existing test caught this in
over 700 prior tests because jsdom's programmatic `.click()` has no
hit-testing - a real Chromium `scripts/browser-check/community-challenge-lifecycle.mjs`
run (built for this sweep) is what surfaced it. Fixed by moving
`renderConfirmSheet()` to the end of the concatenation; pinned two ways, a
source-order change-detector and a real render-path DOM-position assertion,
both in `test/community-confirm-flow.test.mjs`.

Browser scenario coverage: `scripts/browser-check/lib/mockCloud.mjs` is a
new harness that boots the real `index.html`/`cloud.js` in real Chromium
against the same `test/helpers/mockSupabase.mjs` every node integration test
already uses - `vendor/supabase.js`'s network request is intercepted and
replaced with a no-op script, and an `addInitScript` defines
`window.supabase.createClient()` to return the mock client before any page
script runs, plus a defensive `page.route(/supabase\.co/, abort)` net. This
was necessary, not optional: `cloud-config.js` points at the real, live
production Supabase project (see the module's own build notes), there is no
local-only demo backend, and running unattended CI browser scenarios that
write real challenges/events/follows/coach actions against that project was
never going to be acceptable. Seven scenarios, one file each:
`community-challenge-lifecycle.mjs` (create/join/leave), `community-event-rsvp.mjs`
(RSVP + the capacity figure updating immediately after the write - see that
file's own header for why genuine cross-device Postgres realtime push still
cannot be simulated this way, the same class of gap already logged for
Phase 0's local pgTAP situation), `community-notification-center.mjs`,
`community-search.mjs`, `community-directory-follow.mjs`, `community-recap.mjs`,
`community-coach-congratulate.mjs`.

Dialog keyboard/focus coverage: `challengeView`, `eventView`, and
`recapView` are real new Phase 2 modal dialogs wired into the exact same
`CLOUD_DIALOGS` shared-contract registry every Phase 1 dialog uses, but had
never had the opener-stored/first-control-focused/Tab-trap/Escape/restore
contract pinned - closed in `test/community-dialog-focus.test.mjs`, 3 new
tests, following COMM-190's established pattern exactly.

**A real mismatch, flagged rather than papered over**: COMM-234's own
acceptance criteria name five dialogs needing this same keyboard contract -
"challenge create/edit, event create/edit, directory filter panel, push
permission prompt, coach Congratulate confirm." None of the five exist as
an actual `.modal-overlay` dialog in the shipped client. Challenge and event
create/edit (`renderChallengeForm`/`renderEventForm`) are inline
`<form class="chart-card admin-card">` cards in the normal document flow,
never overlays. There is no directory filter panel anywhere in COMM-231's
shipped Directory screen - a search box plus a staff/members split, nothing
else. The "push permission prompt" is the native
`Notification.requestPermission()` browser chrome COMM-229's
`enableNotifPush()` calls - entirely outside the DOM, no app markup to trap
focus inside. Congratulate (COMM-225) is deliberately one-tap-is-confirmation
by design, no confirm dialog at all - `congratulateCelebrateItem()`'s own
comment in cloud.js says so, and `test/community-coach-tools.test.mjs`
already covers the disabled-after-send/no-second-send/failed-retry shape
that design implies. This is a wording mismatch between COMM-234's own
acceptance criteria and what those five earlier tickets actually shipped as
- not a gap this sweep could close by writing tests against markup that
does not exist. Documented in `test/community-dialog-focus.test.mjs`'s own
comment so a future sweep does not miscount it as untested.

Spec-ambiguity pinning, per COMM-234's own acceptance criteria: COMM-208
(joined/completed notification routing - batched to every OTHER active
participant, never the actor, never immediate) is now pinned twice, once at
the DB layer (`supabase/tests/0035_challenge_progress_notifications_test.sql`,
new this sweep) and once implicitly at the client layer (the notification
center just renders whatever rows exist, so the DB layer is the only place
this behavior can actually be pinned). COMM-216 (companion `POST_EVENT` +
reused `post_comments`, not a polymorphic comment target) and COMM-224
(Welcome as a public `add_post_comment` on the member's own card, not a
private message - consistent with the phase's "no Message affordance
anywhere" resolution) were both already pinned as executing tests before
this sweep, in `test/community-events.test.mjs` and
`test/community-coach-tools.test.mjs` respectively - confirmed, not
re-added.

Confirmed, not re-tested: the COMM-228 search-result-to-event-detail wiring
this cluster's own note above already says COMM-213 closed
(`test/community-events.test.mjs`, "a search result's open-event action
opens the real event detail"). The `follows_visible` RLS scope limit
(another member's profile shows a plain follower count, no expand) is
intentional by design and already pinned as such in
`test/community-following-surface.test.mjs` ("offers no expand affordance") -
confirmed this is not a silently-missing feature, no change needed. The
COMM-228 caret-preservation flake logged in the analytics cluster's commit
(a boot-time welcome-modal focus timer racing a test's own focus call) has
its 150ms settle delay already inherited by every new `activeElement`-
asserting test added this sweep, via the shared `openCommunity()` helper in
`test/community-dialog-focus.test.mjs`; re-ran that file three times back to
back with no flake observed.

No schema boundary bug was found by any of this sweep's new RLS/runtime
coverage - every new assertion passed on first real run against the
existing shipped SQL, so no COMM-019/020-style follow-up migration was
needed this time.

## Phase 3 tickets, Intelligence (spec V2)

ID range COMM-300 to COMM-317. Ticket files are in `docs/community/tickets/`.
COMM-300 is a new ticket number, not one of the 17 titles this phase started
with: it is the attendance-logging mechanism itself — the thing the
2026-08-30 resolution settled the *source* of ("self-reported, a
workout/session log entry standing in for a class check-in, not Arbox, not a
dedicated check-in flow") but never built. It did not fit as a subsection of
any of the 17 existing titles without hiding a real, separately-testable
piece of schema work inside an unrelated ticket, so it gets its own number,
consistent with the existing COMM-3xx convention, immediately before
COMM-301.

**Build order: COMM-300 first, ahead of every other Phase 3 schema work.**
It is the critical path for six of the seventeen numbered tickets
(COMM-302, COMM-304, COMM-305, COMM-306, COMM-307, COMM-316) and closes all
seven items in the parked bucket below (COMM-P06 and COMM-P07 both fold into
COMM-316). Recommended order after that: feed (COMM-301 for the extraction,
then COMM-302 since it is now unblocked, then COMM-306, COMM-307, COMM-303
last since it builds on 301/302), achievements (COMM-305), coach-tools
(COMM-304, then COMM-315), recaps (COMM-309, then COMM-316), challenges
(COMM-308, unblocked from the start, no ordering constraint), admin-moderation
(COMM-310 through COMM-313, in that order — each later one in that cluster
reads the one before it; **corrected while building: the 312/313 pair is the
other way round, see the admin-moderation section below**), identity-privacy (COMM-314, unblocked from the
start), qa (COMM-317, last, the phase's merge gate, same role COMM-234 played
for Phase 2).

### attendance foundation

| ID | Title | Agent | Attendance-blocked | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| COMM-300 | Attendance-log mechanism and the ATTENDANCE_RECORDED source | schema | no — this is the unblock | done |

The Phase 3 tables started without the `Status` column every earlier phase's
table carries, because nothing in the phase had been built yet. This one
gains it now that a ticket has actually landed; the other Phase 3 tables
below pick it up as each cluster ships, rather than being pre-filled with
`todo` in a bulk edit that would touch every other agent's rows.

**COMM-300 is in review, and the six tickets it gated are unblocked.**
Shipped as `202608310001_attendance_log.sql`, with
`supabase/tests/0037_attendance_log_test.sql` (54 assertions) and
`test/community-attendance-log-rls.test.mjs` (22). See "Phase 3 schema
handoff for qa" below for the per-boundary detail and the three places the
built thing differs from this ticket's own migration outline. COMM-302,
COMM-304, COMM-305, COMM-306, COMM-307 and COMM-316 may all start.

Ships first. New `attendance_log` table, one row per `(user_id,
occurred_on)`, populated by a trigger on the existing `private_records`
table (the offline training log's own sync store, 202608260001) — not a new
check-in screen. No client insert/update/delete grant on the table at all;
the trigger is the only writer. Gives `ATTENDANCE_RECORDED` (defined with
zero producers since COMM-012) its first real client-side emit and its
first analytics event. Builds nothing that *reads* attendance yet — every
downstream ticket below does that. See COMM-300's own "Note on what
'verified' means here": every later ticket titled "verified attendance"
means "derived server-side from the member's own private training log," the
same trust boundary `private_records` already has today, not a physical or
staff-confirmed check-in. **202609060024 settled that in the schema**: the
table comment said "Verified class attendance" and three function comments
said "verified attendance"; all four now say self-reported training days.
"Class" never belonged in the phrase — class scheduling and check-in are
Arbox's, which this app reads from and does not manage. The misnomer had
already produced a privacy policy claiming class attendance was recorded and
a coach dashboard reporting the most loyal members as never having trained.

### feed

| ID | Title | Agent | Attendance-blocked | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| COMM-301 | Relationship score from interaction history | feed | no | done |
| COMM-302 | Recurring classmate score once attendance lands | feed | was — unblocked by COMM-300 | done |
| COMM-303 | Personalized feed ranking and per-user weights | feed | no | review — **storage and reader only; the derivation is NOT built** |
| COMM-306 | Consistency leaderboard on verified attendance | feed | was — unblocked by COMM-300 | done |
| COMM-307 | Post-class trained-with-you card | feed | was — unblocked by COMM-300 | review — **both halves in; the client half landed too** |

**COMM-301 is in review.** Shipped as `202608310002_relationship_score.sql`,
with `supabase/tests/0038_relationship_score_test.sql` (26 assertions) and no
client change at all — no new call, no changed signature, so no node-side
test moved. A pure extraction: `feed_page`'s body is byte-identical to
202608280019 apart from the two edits this ticket names, and the ranked order
and `feed_score` values for a fixture set were captured from the pre-refactor
function and are asserted against the post-refactor one to six decimal
places. COMM-303 can now read `relationship_score()`'s output as a component
it reweights without knowing its internals. `people_suggestions` (COMM-232)
was left untouched, per COMM-301's own scope boundary, and 0038 asserts that
too.

**COMM-302 is in review, and it closes the parked COMM-P01.** Shipped as
`202608310003_classmate_signal.sql`, with
`supabase/tests/0039_classmate_signal_test.sql` (37 assertions) and no client
change at all — both functions keep their exact signatures and
`people_suggestions`' returned shape only gains a key, so nothing on the node
side moved (791/790/1/0, unchanged). `feed_page`'s `v_class_connection` is no
longer a hard 0: it is `least(1.0, shared_days / 8.0)` over a trailing 60-day
window, multiplied by the `v_w_class = 6` that was reserved for it in
202608280019. `people_suggestions` gained the fourth branch its own migration
comment promised, and its priority order is now challenge, classmate,
interaction, event. One function beyond the ticket's outline:
`classmate_day_counts()`, internal and ungranted, so the window, the overlap
count and the `show_attendance` gate exist once rather than twice — see the
handoff section below.

**COMM-306 is in review, and it closes the parked COMM-P02.** Shipped as
`202608310004_consistency_on_attendance.sql`, with
`supabase/tests/0040_consistency_on_attendance_test.sql` (31 assertions) and
no client change at all — `feed_leaderboard` and `community_profile` keep
their exact signatures and their exact shapes, so nothing on the node side
moved (791/790/1/0, unchanged). `consistency_week_streaks()`'s body is the
same arithmetic over `attendance_log.occurred_on` instead of
`workout_posts`, which is precisely the one-function change its own
202608290015 comment named; `community_profile`'s inline second copy moved
with it in the same migration, so the standing "the two cannot drift"
assertion in 0034 is re-run against the new source rather than retired, and
0040 widens it from the caller to every member on the board. Consistency mode
now also gates on `can_view_profile_field(member, 'show_attendance')` —
absent from the ranked set, not ranked at 0. One thing beyond the ticket's
outline: `community_profile`'s `current_streak` key is gated on that toggle
too, because the number is attendance-derived now — see the handoff section
below. `training_frequency` and `recent_workouts` are untouched.

**COMM-307 is in review — BOTH HALVES — and it closes the parked COMM-P05.**
The schema half shipped as
`202608310005_attendance_classmates_today.sql`, with
`supabase/tests/0041_attendance_classmates_today_test.sql` (35 assertions).
One new function, `attendance_classmates_today(p_limit int default 6)`, and
nothing else: no new table, no re-created function, no changed signature. It joins
`attendance_log` to itself on `occurred_on = current_date` and returns
`{user_id, display_name, handle, avatar_url}` for every other member who
trained today, gated per candidate by
`can_view_profile_field(candidate, 'show_attendance')` — the identical call
`classmate_day_counts()` makes, which carries block edges in both directions,
deleted profiles and `visible_to_club` with it. Two decisions the ticket left
open and this half settled, both in the handoff section below: the **caller's
own** `show_attendance` is enforced inside the function (empty set, never a
raise) rather than left to the client, and `p_limit` clamps 1..20 defaulting
to 6.

**The client half has now landed too**, in `cloud.js`, `src/analytics.js` and
`docs/community/metrics.md`, with `test/community-classmates-today.test.mjs`
(11 tests). The node suite moves 791/790/1/0 → **802/801/1/0**. What is in it:

- The card in COMM-115's feed top area, above the feed list, in the same
  `chart-card` shell and the same "renders nothing at all" omission style as
  the upcoming-event card (COMM-217) that shares the slot. One
  `attendance_classmates_today({ p_limit: 6 })` per feed session, issued from
  `afterRenderCommunity()` on the Feed sub-tab — the lazy pattern the
  consistency board and the directory already use, **not** `refreshSession()`'s
  boot batch, because the caller's own row for today is written by the
  `private_records` trigger behind `flushOutbox()`, which runs *after* that
  batch. Rendered in the order returned; never re-sorted.
- **Four ways to get no card, one behaviour.** Empty set, caller did not train,
  caller's own `show_attendance` off, failed fetch — all render nothing at all.
  No heading, no empty state, no retry, and no skeleton either: the slot's
  other occupant has none, and `show_attendance` defaults to false, so a
  placeholder would be the thing most members actually see. The client makes no
  attempt to tell the three server-side empties apart; it cannot, by design.
- **The Follow control is rendered on every row**, unlike `memberRowHtml()` and
  `followListRowHtml()`, which guard on `allow_follows`. The RPC returns four
  keys and `allow_follows` is not one of them, on purpose (contracts.md: "this
  is not a follow strip"), so there is nothing to guard on;
  `follows_insert_self` refuses the insert server-side and the existing
  `follow()` error path reports it exactly as it does everywhere else. No new
  follow mechanism and no client pre-filter that would leak another member's
  setting into the card.
- No Message affordance, per the standing no-messaging resolution — asserted,
  not just absent.
- `classmates_card_viewed` (`rows`, `source`), once per load of the card and
  never per re-render, fired from the render hook rather than the fetch because
  a fetch that answered is not yet a view. **Not** in `ACTIVE_MEMBER_EVENTS`:
  viewing a card is not participation (`leaderboard_viewed`'s reasoning), and
  the training behind it is already counted once as `attendance_recorded`.

One thing a reviewer should look at rather than skim: **the ticket's "Loading:
the feed top area's existing skeleton pattern (COMM-115)" was read as "the
pattern that slot actually has", which is no skeleton.** See the comment in
`renderClassmatesTodayCard()`. Nothing else in Phase 3 is waiting on either
half.

**COMM-303 is in review, and it closes the feed cluster — but read what it
does and does not contain before treating personalization as shipped.**
Shipped as `202608310006_personalized_feed_weights.sql`, with
`supabase/tests/0042_personalized_feed_weights_test.sql` (61 assertions) and
**no client change at all** — the ticket says so itself ("No new UI —
personalization is invisible ranking, not a setting"), `feed_page` keeps its
exact signature and returned columns, and the node suite is unchanged at
802/801/1/0.

**WHAT IS NOT BUILT, flagged here so it is not mistaken for a completed
feature: the weight-derivation algorithm.** Nothing in this ticket ever
writes a `member_feed_weights` row, and nothing derives a multiplier from a
member's `feed_interactions` history. `recompute_feed_weights(p_limit)` ships
as a real, granted, service-role-only function whose body is empty and always
returns 0. **So today every member has no row, and therefore every member
gets the fixed defaults and the feed order this module has always
produced.** That is the intended end state of COMM-303, not a gap in it — the
ticket puts the derivation out of scope explicitly, in the same "storage
exists, computation/delivery does not" bucket as the notification batch
flusher (202608280028: `notification_batches` written, nothing scheduled to
flush them) and `recap_weekly`'s own cron gap. What ships is the **storage**
and the **reader**: the table, its boundary, the redistribution arithmetic,
and `feed_page` falling back correctly.

What did land: `member_feed_weights` (own-row select, no client write grant of
any kind, service-role writer only, the `weekly_recaps` shape);
`feed_weights_resolve(p_user, p_defaults)`, internal and ungranted, holding
the clamp and the redistribution; and `feed_page` re-created a third time so
its eight weights are resolved per caller instead of being `constant`. Two
things a reviewer should look at rather than skim, both in the handoff section
below: **the sum invariant is a bounded proportional rescale, not a clamp**
(a naive clamp-and-use does not sum to anything fixed, and a naive rescale
breaks the clamp — both are shown with a worked counterexample), and **the
"positive weights sum to 104" comment was stale by 6 and is corrected to 110
without moving a single weight**.

COMM-301 extracts `feed_page`'s already-inline relationship arithmetic
(202608280019) into a reusable `relationship_score()` helper with no ranking
change — a prerequisite for COMM-303's per-user weighting, not for anything
attendance-related. COMM-307 closes COMM-P05, a new
feed-top-area card (`attendance_classmates_today()`) distinct from COMM-302's
suggestions-strip signal — "who trained today", not "who to follow". COMM-303
landed last in this cluster: it personalizes the weights COMM-301 extracted
and reads COMM-302's class-connection component as one of the things it can
reweight, with `v_w_class` deliberately not special-cased as immovable.

### achievements

| ID | Title | Agent | Attendance-blocked | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| COMM-305 | Attendance milestone posts and achievements activation | achievements | was — unblocked by COMM-300 | done |

**COMM-305 is in review, and it closes the parked COMM-P03.** Shipped as
`202608310007_attendance_achievements.sql`, with
`supabase/tests/0043_attendance_achievements_test.sql` (50 assertions) and no
client change at all — no new call, no changed signature, and the metadata
shape the trigger writes is the one `renderAttendanceMilestonePostCard` has
read since Phase 1, so nothing on the node side moved (802/801/1/0,
unchanged). The four `ATTENDANCE_RECORDED` definitions are `enabled = true`;
an AFTER INSERT trigger on `attendance_log` mints the unlocks and, for the 25
and 100 milestones only, one authorless club-visible
`POST_ATTENDANCE_MILESTONE` per crossing gated on the member's own
`show_attendance`. `POST_ATTENDANCE_MILESTONE` has a producer for the first
time since COMM-001 added the enum label. Two things beyond the ticket's
outline, both in the handoff section below: a helper function
`attendance_week_streak(uuid, date)` so the streak arithmetic is not a second
copy of COMM-306's rule that could drift, and the count milestones testing
state rather than a just-crossed delta (a delta silently awards nothing on any
multi-row insert). `ach_claim` is untouched and still refuses all four codes;
the generic `ach_evaluate` consumer is still not built and this ticket
deliberately does not build it.

Closes COMM-P03. Flips the four seeded `ATTENDANCE_RECORDED`
`achievement_definitions` rows (202608280007) to `enabled = true` and gives
`POST_ATTENDANCE_MILESTONE` (a post_type enum label and client card contract
since Phase 1, never produced) its first real producer. Evaluated directly
off `attendance_log` by a table trigger, the same "no generic event-bus
consumer exists in this codebase, a table trigger does the job instead"
precedent `challenge_progress_apply`'s milestone post already set — this
ticket does not build the still-missing generic `ach_evaluate` path either.
Never client-claimable: `ach_claim` already refuses any
`trigger_type = 'ATTENDANCE_RECORDED'` code (202608280020) and this ticket
does not touch that refusal.

### coach-tools

| ID | Title | Agent | Attendance-blocked | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| COMM-304 | Coach Engage activation and attendance-decline detection | coach-tools | was — unblocked by COMM-300 | review — both halves in |
| COMM-315 | Member of the week rotation across recognition categories | coach-tools | no | review — both halves in |

**COMM-304 is in review — BOTH HALVES — and it closes the parked COMM-P04.**
`coach_engagement_flags` has shipped empty since Phase 0 (202608280011) with
a comment naming this exact ticket; COMM-226 already built the Engage
section as a flag-gated hidden shell reading it — the schema half
(`1f8069d`) gives the table its first producer,
`coach_detect_engagement_decline()`, a service_role-only scheduled job that
compares an 8-week baseline to a 2-week recent window per member off
`attendance_log` and buckets into mild/significant/inactive via named
tuning constants; the client half (`c03eca7`) flips COMM-226's flag to
default-on and adds a translated level badge (never the raw enum or the
underlying session figures), review/dismiss (a direct RLS update, no
migration needed — verified against 202608280011's staff policy), and a
"reach out" one-tap action modeled on COMM-225's congratulate pattern. The
single most important existing rule, `user_id <> auth.uid()` on every
policy, is untouched by this ticket and gets extra qa scrutiny in COMM-317
now that the table has real rows for the first time. Two real gaps found
and left open: the ticket's empty-state copy doesn't match what COMM-226
actually shipped (went with the ticket's literal text), and
`profiles_read_authenticated` only bypasses `visible_to_club=false` for
`is_admin()`, not `is_staff()` — a non-admin coach resolving a flagged
member with a hidden profile gets a generic fallback label rather than a
name; the client degrades safely, but the policy gap itself is unfixed.
COMM-315 had no forward reference anywhere in this repo's docs and was
flagged as an open question in its own ticket file — the category set and
rotation order proposed there (consistency streak, PRs, challenge
completion, coach's pick) was the planner's best-effort reading of the
title, not settled spec text. **The user confirmed that proposal as-is on
2026-08-31, and both halves are now in review** (schema `202609010001`,
client `79664bf`). The
rotation index is whole weeks since the epoch Monday 2026-01-05 modulo 4,
not the ISO week number — an ISO year has 52 or 53 weeks, so the mod-4 form
of the week number repeats a category two weeks running at every 53-week
year (2026 is one), which a "stated, auditable, repeatable" order cannot
afford. Three of the four categories compute a suggestion from existing
data and none of them auto-publishes; every candidate passes the subject's
own toggle (`in_leaderboards` for streak and challenge, `show_prs` for PRs,
the same rule `coach_celebrate_feed` follows) **and the same toggles read
from the raw `profiles` columns**, which is the one place this went past the
Celebrate pattern. `can_view_profile_field()` short-circuits to true for an
admin before it reads any toggle, so through the helper alone an admin would
have been offered — and could have published — a "most PRs this week"
celebration of a member who keeps their PRs private. Celebrate shows a coach
a private dashboard row; this shows a caller a row they are about to
broadcast, so an admin's rank must not override a member's own choice. The
helper call is kept alongside the columns because it is the only thing that
settles block edges, and both halves are mutation-tested separately in 0045. Publishing writes an authorless
`POST_ANNOUNCEMENT` — the first producer that post type has ever had —
rather than reusing COMM-225's comment-on-a-card pattern, because three of
the four categories have no source post to comment on. Three real gaps left
open and not papered over: the consistency category reads
`feed_leaderboard`, which reports the streak **as of now** and takes no
as-of date, so publishing a months-old week under that category credits a
present-day streak; `show_attendance` and `show_prs` both default **false**,
so in a club where nobody has opted in, two of the four categories will
legitimately show the empty state most weeks; and nothing notifies the
member they were chosen, which the ticket does not ask for and which would
be a `notif_create` fan-out or a follow-up. The client half builds one
staff-only Coach Dashboard section (`renderCoachMemberOfWeekSection`) on
top of both functions: a single publish path serves both a computed
candidate's one-tap Publish and the free-form coach's-pick (the server, not
the client, decides which category the row records, so the client never
sends one and always re-fetches after a successful publish), all five real
Postgres error messages the schema half raises are mapped to short Hebrew,
and the frontend states match the ticket literally — candidates and the
coach's-pick form render together whenever the category has candidates, not
one-or-the-other.

### recaps

| ID | Title | Agent | Attendance-blocked | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| COMM-309 | Monthly club recap Edge Function with admin preview | recaps | no | review — both halves in |
| COMM-316 | Monthly recap classmates and onboarding class steps, attendance | recaps | was — unblocked by COMM-300 | review — both halves in |

**COMM-309 is in review — BOTH HALVES.** Not attendance-blocked in the
gating sense — it could be built any time after COMM-300 exists in the
schema, since one of its aggregate figures (`sessions_logged`) reads
`attendance_log`, but every other figure does not depend on it. It is also
the first ticket to give aggregate, club-wide attendance figures any club
visibility, and stays aggregate-only forever — enforced by the table's own
shape (no `user_id`, no jsonb, no text column) rather than by convention,
unlike COMM-316's per-recap classmates line. Generation shipped as a
service-role-only Postgres function (`recap_monthly_generate`, schema
`f0482fc`) rather than an Edge Function like `recap_weekly` — no scheduler
built yet, matching every other periodic job in this module; a draft only
exists once someone invokes it by hand. The client half (`053ff8f`) adds a
Coach Dashboard preview with a publish control gated on
`community.analytics.view` or `is_admin()` (deliberately narrower than the
staff read policy — a coach can preview a draft but not publish it, per
the schema's own documented asymmetry) and a member-facing card on the
Account tab beside the existing weekly-recap entry that renders nothing at
all until a month is actually published.

**COMM-316 is in review — BOTH HALVES — and closes both COMM-P06 and
COMM-P07 in one ticket.** `weekly_recaps` gains a named classmates line (an
own-row surface, so naming individuals is fine, unlike COMM-309's club-wide
one) via `recap_weekly_classmates(p_user, p_week_start, p_limit)`
(schema `cdde05c`) and `onboarding_progress` gains the two class-attendance
steps COMM-222 explicitly deferred here by name. The real find: this
function runs as service_role with no session, so `can_view_profile_field()`
— every other Phase 3 reader's privacy resolution point — would resolve its
viewer from a null `auth.uid()` and return false for every candidate,
forever, silently. Verified directly against a service-role session before
writing the fix. The gate is instead written out term-for-term against an
explicit `p_user` parameter, deliberately omitting the helper's `is_admin()`
short-circuit — a weekly recap is a persisted, shareable artifact (COMM-221's
Share Recap), not a live view, so a member's own toggle outranks the
subject's rank, the same reasoning COMM-315 already established. The
feature half (`b3747d2`) wires `recap_weekly` (the Edge Function) to call
the new RPC once per member per week and renders the line in `cloud.js`;
the two onboarding steps rank after all three existing COMM-222 steps
rather than between them, a documented judgment call that keeps "these two
steps don't reorder the existing three" a structural guarantee. Flagged,
not fixed: `recap_weekly/index.ts` has no executing test coverage
anywhere in this repo (no Deno/Node harness exists for Edge Functions at
all) — same position every other helper in that file was already in.

### challenges

| ID | Title | Agent | Attendance-blocked | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| COMM-308 | Advanced challenge team management | challenges | no | review — both halves in |

**COMM-308 is in review — BOTH HALVES.** Not attendance-blocked, no
ordering constraint against the rest of the phase. Coach-driven team CRUD,
member reassignment, and a captain label on top of COMM-204's existing team
challenge shape — no forward reference existed for this one either, but the
delta from COMM-204's shipped scope is concrete enough that this ticket
does not carry the same "open question" flag COMM-311/312/313/315 do. The
real find: the ticket's own acceptance criteria stated as fact that a plain
member's `challenge_participants_update_self` policy already refuses
setting `team_id` to a value they didn't pick at join — it doesn't; the
policy has no column restriction at all. Verified against the shipped
policy before writing the fix (schema `7e2f908`): a new trigger makes one
pick from null allowed (the only team write COMM-204's shipped client ever
makes) and refuses any later change by a non-holder. `captain_id` gets the
same "policy already allows the write, pin the column to the function
anyway" treatment `protect_is_admin()` established for
`recovery_verified_at`/`assigned_coach_id`, so every captain change is
audited even though the existing team UPDATE policy is technically wide
enough to set it directly. Team deletion with active members is refused by
a real trigger, not just client discipline — with a documented cascade
escape hatch so deleting a whole team challenge still works. The client
half (`f601dd4`) adds a staff-only management card below COMM-204's
unchanged member-facing team columns (verified byte-identical for a plain
member) with rename/delete/create, a captain picker, and a per-member team
reassignment picker; the captain badge itself is staff-only in this
ticket's reading of the frontend-states text, flagged as a real ambiguity
worth a second look if the intent was actually club-wide visibility.

### admin-moderation

| ID | Title | Agent | Attendance-blocked | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| COMM-310 | Admin community analytics dashboard, full metric set | admin-moderation | no | review — both halves in |
| COMM-311 | Member engagement segmentation | admin-moderation | no | review — both halves in |
| COMM-312 | Community health score, internal only | admin-moderation | no | review — both halves in |
| COMM-313 | Retention correlation views | admin-moderation | no | review — both halves in |

**The whole admin-moderation cluster is in review — all four tickets, both
halves each.** Built in real dependency order (310 → 311 → 313 → 312, not
the ticket numbering order — see the ordering-correction note above)
rather than the numbering order, since COMM-312 genuinely reads COMM-313's
retention signal and COMM-313 does not read COMM-312 despite the ticket
text listing it as a dependency. COMM-310 shipped the shared foundation
every other ticket in the cluster reuses: `analytics_wcam_events()` (the
one server-side WCAM definition, mirroring `ACTIVE_MEMBER_EVENTS` in
`src/analytics.js`) and, client-side, the admin analytics dashboard shell
and period selector. COMM-311's segments and COMM-310's own metrics share
that one shell, gated on `has_perm('community.analytics.view') or
is_admin()`; COMM-312 and COMM-313 both instead gate on real `is_admin()`
alone — narrower on purpose, since a retention curve or an interpretive
composite score travels worse out of context than a raw count — and both
render as their own standalone sections rather than nested inside the
broader-gated shell, so the boundary stays visible at each section's own
call site instead of being buried inside a container whose header belongs
to a wider audience. None of these four are attendance-blocked, but COMM-313's onboarding-step
correlation reads COMM-316's two new columns, so it is ordered after the
recaps cluster above despite not being attendance-blocked itself. COMM-310
is the one ticket in this cluster with real grounding: `docs/community/
metrics.md`'s existing "Core metrics" and "Additional metrics" sections are
its whole scope, no new metric invented. COMM-311, COMM-312, and COMM-313
have no forward reference anywhere in this repo's docs — each ticket file
flags this explicitly and proposes a conservative, best-effort shape rather
than inventing spec text this planner never had.

**Ordering correction, made while building COMM-313.** The cluster does not
run strictly 310 → 311 → 312 → 313. COMM-310 → COMM-311 → COMM-313 does hold
(each reads `analytics_wcam_events()` from 310, and 313 is the more aggregate
sibling of 311), but **COMM-313 does not read COMM-312 at all** — its
acceptance criteria and client contracts never mention
`community_health_scores` or any COMM-312 function, and the only thing it
borrows from that ticket is the *wording* of the permission gate. **COMM-312
does read COMM-313**: its score names "a retention signal (COMM-313, once it
exists)" as one of four weighted inputs. So the real order is **310 → 311 →
313 → 312**, which is the order taken. COMM-313's schema half shipped in
`202609010008` (`retention_cohorts`, `retention_onboarding_correlation`,
`retention_welcome_correlation`, plus a private `retention_member_weeks()`
granted to no role and a `retention_min_cohort_size()` constant) with pgTAP
`0052`; its client half is still open. COMM-312 now has its retention input
available and should call one of those rather than re-derive a curve.

**COMM-312's schema half then shipped in `202609010009`** with pgTAP `0053`
(101 assertions; the suite went 1854 → 1955): the `community_health_scores`
table with a single `is_admin()` select policy and no client write grant at
all, `community_health_generate(p_week_start)` (service-role only, idempotent
per week, no scheduler — the same open infra item five other functions carry),
`community_health_history(p_weeks)` and a private
`community_health_component()`. Its client half is still open. It **did** read
COMM-313, as predicted — its retention component is the pooled week-4 retained
share out of the private `retention_member_weeks(6)`, which is the only one of
that migration's functions a service-role job can call, since the other three
raise on a null `auth.uid()`. That same `auth.uid()` fact is why nothing in
COMM-312 calls `analytics_dashboard()` either; WCAM share and engagement per
post are recomputed from `analytics_wcam_events()` and COMM-310's own
denominator. **One new open item came out of it, against COMM-313 rather than
COMM-312**: `retention_member_weeks()` is anchored on `now()` and takes no
as-of parameter, so a health score's retention component is measured as of the
run and not as of the scored week — harmless on a weekly schedule, misleading
in a backfill. Full reasoning, including the weight split and the two
normalisation constants, is in `docs/community/contracts.md` under "Needs from
schema, community health score (COMM-312, Phase 3)".

**With that, all four admin-moderation schema halves are shipped** (COMM-310
`202609010006`, COMM-311 `202609010007`, COMM-313 `202609010008`, COMM-312
`202609010009`). Four client halves remain open in this cluster.

### identity-privacy

| ID | Title | Agent | Attendance-blocked | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| COMM-314 | Versioned abandoned-profile purge Edge Function and runbook | identity-privacy | no | review — no client surface (scheduled job only) |

Not the same job as the already-shipped `purge_due_accounts()`
(202608260001, a member's own *explicit* deletion request, purged 30 days
after they ask). This is a different, new category: an anonymous
`auth.users` account that never redeemed an invite and never verified
recovery, sitting abandoned. COMM-314 shipped: `202609010004`
(`public.purge_abandoned_profiles(p_retention_days)`, 30-day window
confirmed 2026-08-31) plus
`supabase/functions/purge_abandoned_profiles/index.ts` and
`docs/community/abandoned-profile-purge-runbook.md`. The Edge Function
calls the Postgres function over RPC rather than reading `auth.users`
directly — see `docs/community/contracts.md`'s "purge_abandoned_profiles —
SHIPPED" entry for why.

### qa

| ID | Title | Agent | Attendance-blocked | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| COMM-317 | Phase 3 QA sweep | qa | no | done — see summary below |

Last, the phase's merge gate, same role COMM-234 played for Phase 2.
Depends on every other Phase 3 ticket.

**COMM-317, the Phase 3 QA sweep and merge gate, DONE.** Cross-referenced
every Phase 3 ticket's (COMM-300 through COMM-316) acceptance criteria
against the existing suite, closed the real gaps found, and re-verified all
three CI jobs independently from a genuinely fresh state (a local Docker
Supabase stack, `supabase db reset --local` then `supabase test db`, and a
clean `npm test`) rather than trusting any earlier agent's own report — the
same discipline COMM-234 held for Phase 2.

**A real bug found and fixed, not just flagged.**
`renderConsistencyLeaderboardSection()`'s own footer note on the "טבלת
עקביות" board — `"רצף שבועות רצופים עם אימון מתועד. נתוני נוכחות מאומתים
יתווספו בהמשך"` ("...verified attendance data will be added later") — dated
back to COMM-210 (Phase 2), when the board still ranked
`workout_posts`-derived streaks and the line was an honest "coming later"
promise. COMM-306 (Phase 3) replaced `consistency_week_streaks()`'s body
with `attendance_log` without anyone updating this copy, so the shipped
client told every member the exact feature already running under their feet
was still pending — the one place this sweep found the shipped copy
actually contradicting COMM-300's own "verified means self-reported, not
physically verified" framing (see below), rather than merely under- or
over-stating it. Corrected in `cloud.js` to `"הרצף מבוסס על אימונים שתועדו
ביומן האימונים האישי, לא על פרסום בפיד"` ("...based on sessions logged in
the personal training log, not on a feed post"), and pinned against
regression in `test/community-leaderboards-and-suggestions.test.mjs`.

**COMM-300's "self-reported, not physically verified" framing**, the one
item this phase's tickets flagged as still open at build time: confirmed
accurate everywhere else it appears. The migration's own "Note on what
'verified' means here" (202608310001) states it in exactly those terms, the
`attendance_log` pgTAP file proves at runtime that a member's own device is
the only path a row is ever written through (see below), and every later
ticket's client-facing copy this sweep audited (the classmates card, the
recap classmates line, the achievement unlock copy) describes a training
log entry, never a physical check-in or staff confirmation. The one
contradiction found is the stale consistency-board footer note above, now
fixed.

**`attendance_log`'s "only path" boundary (COMM-300), now proven twice at
runtime, not only read off `pg_catalog`.**
`supabase/tests/0037_attendance_log_test.sql` already had a member and an
admin attempt a direct insert and get refused (`throws_ok`, genuinely
executed) — that half was already real. Added: the same for the writer
function itself. As `authenticated` (a member, then an admin), calling
`public.attendance_log_from_record()` directly — not merely inserting into
`attendance_log` — is refused at runtime with a real permission error,
before Postgres even asks whether this is a trigger context. And as the
bootstrap superuser, who bypasses every grant this file's fixtures rely on
to build with RLS out of the way, the call is *still* refused — genuinely
executed and caught — because the function is declared `returns trigger`
and Postgres itself will not run one outside trigger context. So the
boundary holds twice over: nobody is granted execute, and even a grant
would not be enough. Three new pgTAP assertions.

**Re-verified rather than assumed, against real producer output, not empty-
table shape or planted rows:**
- `coach_engagement_flags`'s "the flagged member can never read their own
  row, even as staff or admin" — `supabase/tests/0044_coach_engagement_
  decline_test.sql` runs `coach_detect_engagement_decline()` for real, nine
  times, flags a real coach and a real admin, and then re-asserts both
  cannot read their own row through the table's own RLS. Already real
  before this sweep touched it; confirmed rather than re-added.
- The four `ATTENDANCE_RECORDED` achievements are not reachable through
  `ach_claim` now that they are `enabled` — `supabase/tests/0043_attendance_
  achievements_test.sql` has a real caller who has genuinely earned all four
  crossings attempt to claim them through `ach_claim(array[...])` and get
  refused on `trigger_type`, with a textual pin that the refusal line itself
  is untouched by COMM-305.
- `consistency_week_streaks()` and `community_profile`'s inline copy still
  agree — `supabase/tests/0040_consistency_on_attendance_test.sql` re-runs
  the "two copies cannot drift" pattern `0034` established, now against the
  attendance-based body and widened from one fixture member to every member
  on the board at once, with a non-vacuous check that the board is not all
  zeros.
- Every function crossing a privacy toggle this phase — `show_attendance` in
  `feed_page`'s classmate component, `people_suggestions`'s classmate signal
  (COMM-302), `attendance_classmates_today()` (COMM-307), the consistency
  board (COMM-306), the weekly recap classmates line (COMM-316); and
  `in_leaderboards`/`show_prs` in `member_of_week_candidates()` (COMM-315) —
  already has a real allow/deny pair per function, each with a positive
  control (the same data, toggle flipped, now included) and a block-edge
  case in both directions. Audited across `0039`, `0040`, `0041`, `0045` and
  `0047`; no gap found.

**Five new `scripts/browser-check` scenarios**, real Chromium against the
same in-page mocked backend (`lib/mockCloud.mjs`) COMM-234's sweep built,
never the real production Supabase project:
`community-classmates-card.mjs` (COMM-307 — drives the real
`window.queueSyncRecord()`/`flushOutbox()` client path to prove the
`ATTENDANCE_RECORDED` bus emit and its analytics row are real, then the
card, its Follow control and its `classmates_card_viewed` event off
`attendance_log` rows standing in for what the Postgres trigger this repo
has no local server to run would have produced);
`community-recap-classmates.mjs` (COMM-316 — the recap dialog's classmates
line, real names not a count, real profile links, the quiet-week empty
line, and that it survives `recap-older`/`recap-newer` navigation);
`community-coach-engage.mjs` (COMM-304 — the Engage section with two real
flagged members for the first time, the one-tap reach-out through a real
`post_create` + `POST_COACH` update, review, and dismiss); `community-
monthly-recap-publish.mjs` (COMM-309 — two-part: a coach previewing a
draft gets no publish control at all, matching the ticket's own explicit
"the preview boundary is WIDER than the publish boundary" warning, then an
admin publishing it for real, plus the server-side "already published"
refusal on a second call); and `community-member-of-week-publish.mjs`
(COMM-315 — the week's real rotation category and its computed candidate,
translated detail text, and a real one-click publish). 24 browser-check
scripts total (19 -> 24), all green.

**Scheduled-job gaps, consolidated in one place, matching how COMM-234
consolidated the notification-batch-flusher gap:** every "infra not built
here" note this phase's tickets and migrations logged individually, in one
list rather than scattered across five files:

| Function | Ticket | What runs it today |
|---|---|---|
| `recompute_feed_weights(p_limit)` | COMM-303 | Nothing. Ships as a granted, service-role-only, no-op stub returning 0 — deliberately not built (202608310006). `member_feed_weights` stays empty, so every member reads the fixed default weights. |
| `coach_detect_engagement_decline()` | COMM-304 | Nothing. Service-role-only, no `auth.uid()` check by design (202608310008) — the grant is the gate, same as the others here. |
| `recap_monthly_generate(p_month_start)` | COMM-309 | Nothing. Shipped as a service-role-only **Postgres function**, not a `supabase/functions/recap_monthly` Edge Function (a deliberate implementation-note deviation from the ticket's own outline, recorded in the migration header and contracts.md) — either shape still needs a caller. |
| `community_health_generate(p_week_start)` | COMM-312 | Nothing. Found this session, not named in COMM-312's own ticket text: its migration's own comment (202609010009) already lists itself alongside the other four in this table as sharing the same open item. |
| `purge_abandoned_profiles` Edge Function | COMM-314 | Nothing scheduled; runnable by hand (curl with a real service-role key, or `select public.purge_abandoned_profiles();` directly) — see `docs/community/abandoned-profile-purge-runbook.md`, which already documents this gap in its own "Nothing schedules this yet" section. |

All five carry the same shape every prior scheduler gap in this repo
already does (`recap_weekly`, `notif_batch_flush_due()`,
`chal_notify_ending_soon()`): a real function, service-role-only, no
`auth.uid()` check by design, waiting on a `pg_cron` entry or an external
scheduler this repo's CI does not provision. None of the five block Phase 3
being done — every one of them ships correctly with an empty/stub result
until a scheduler exists, which is the explicit, stated scope of every
ticket that logged one.

**Full WCAM (Weekly Community Active Members) re-review, playing COMM-233's
role for Phase 2.** Every event Phase 3 adds, checked against
`ACTIVE_MEMBER_EVENTS` explicitly:
- `attendance_recorded` (COMM-300) — **counts.** "Attending" is named
  outright in the WCAM definition (metrics.md section 78), and it is the
  one qualifying activity that can be true for a member who never opened
  the Community tab at all.
- `classmates_card_viewed` (COMM-307) — **does not count**, on the same
  reasoning `leaderboard_viewed` already uses: viewing a card is not
  participation, and the training that produced the card is already counted
  once, as `attendance_recorded`. Double-counting it would also make a
  member active off another member's session.
- COMM-304, COMM-309 and COMM-315 add **no new tracked events** — none of
  their own acceptance criteria call for one (COMM-307 and COMM-300 are the
  only two Phase 3 tickets that do), and independently checking `cloud.js`
  confirms no `analyticsTrack`/`track(A....)` call site exists for the
  Engage section, the monthly recap surfaces, or the member-of-week
  surfaces. Nothing to include or exclude because nothing was added — not
  defaulted, checked.

Both reasoning calls above are already written out in `src/analytics.js`'s
own comments (not merely asserted here), and independently re-derived
rather than trusted: `ACTIVE_MEMBER_EVENTS` (client, `src/analytics.js`),
`analytics_wcam_events()` (server, COMM-310's `202609010006`) and
`docs/community/metrics.md`'s own published SQL all carry the **identical
15-name list, in the identical order** — verified byte-for-byte by hand
this sweep, not just by trusting `0050`'s own pgTAP assertion that already
compares the first two. **No drift found; nothing to fix.**

**Every open question this phase's tickets flagged, checked against what
actually shipped, not trusted from the ticket text alone:** COMM-311's six
buckets (`new`/`declining`/`highly_active`/`steady`/`occasional`/`dormant`,
in that precedence) and COMM-312's four weights (0.40/0.25/0.25/0.10,
independently re-read from `202609010009`'s own constants) both match their
tickets' "Resolved 2026-08-31" sections exactly. COMM-315's rotation
(`member_of_week_category()`, `202609010001`) is `consistency_streak`,
`most_prs`, `challenge_completion`, `coachs_pick` in that order, exactly as
proposed. COMM-314's retention window is 30 days in both the SQL function's
default and the Edge Function's own `RETENTION_DAYS` constant
(`supabase/functions/purge_abandoned_profiles/index.ts`), matching the
runbook. No silent narrowing or widening found anywhere in this set.

**Final counts, from a genuinely fresh state:** `npm test` 907 -> 914 (913
pass, 1 skip, 0 fail — this sweep's own contribution is +1 test, pinning the
stale-copy fix above; the remaining +6 is a concurrent, out-of-scope commit
observed landing on this branch mid-sweep, see note below). `supabase test
db` (a local Docker Supabase stack, `supabase db reset --local` then
`supabase test db`, all 54 migrations applying clean): 1955 -> 1958
assertions across the same 54 files (this sweep's own +3, the
`attendance_log_from_record()` runtime boundary above; no new pgTAP file
needed since no schema gap was found). `scripts/browser-check`: 19 -> 24
scripts, all green.

**A note on scope, not a finding about this ticket:** a second, concurrent
commit (`96157a8`, "Member avatar photo, storage half (COMM-318)") landed on
this branch while this sweep was in progress, from what the session's own
memory record names as the queued next-phase work. COMM-318 is not one of
COMM-300 through COMM-316 and this sweep did not review it — flagged here
only so the `npm test`/pgTAP deltas above are not misread as this sweep's
own regression. `test/community-avatar-photo.test.mjs` (6 tests) is that
commit's own addition, not this one's.

## Parked, attendance-blocked

| ID | Title | Unblocks with | Related phase-3 ticket |
|---|---|---|---|
| COMM-P01 | Feed class-connection score | attendance source | COMM-302 |
| COMM-P02 | Consistency leaderboard on verified attendance | attendance source | COMM-306 |
| COMM-P03 | Attendance-milestone posts and achievements | attendance source | COMM-305 |
| COMM-P04 | Coach Engage section and decline detection | attendance source | COMM-304 |
| COMM-P05 | Post-class trained-with-you card | attendance source | COMM-307 |
| COMM-P06 | Weekly recap classmates line | attendance source | COMM-316 |
| COMM-P07 | Onboarding first and third class steps | attendance source | COMM-316 |

The attendance *source* was resolved 2026-08-30 (self-reported, see below),
but the *mechanism* — the actual table and write path — did not exist until
this planning pass named it COMM-300. Every row above stays in this table,
unchanged, until its named Phase 3 ticket actually ships and closes it; this
table is a historical record of what was parked and why, not a live todo
list to edit as tickets are written. None of the seven is closed by this
planning session — only unblocked.

Updated 2026-08-31: COMM-300 has now shipped (202608310001), so "attendance
source" in the third column is no longer a future thing — `attendance_log`
exists and is populated. All seven rows are genuinely unblocked and none is
closed, exactly as the paragraph above describes: each stays here until its
named Phase 3 ticket ships. COMM-300 built the source and nothing that reads
it.

Updated 2026-08-31, second pass: **COMM-P01 is closed** by COMM-302
(202608310003). `feed_page`'s class-connection component is a real number
computed from `attendance_log`, and `people_suggestions` carries the same
signal as its second-strongest. The row stays in the table above because this
section is a record of what was parked and why, not a live todo list; the
other six remain open and unblocked.

Updated 2026-08-31, third pass: **COMM-P02 is closed** by COMM-306
(202608310004). The consistency board and every profile's `current_streak`
count weeks a member actually trained, from `attendance_log`, instead of weeks
they posted a workout or a PR. The row stays in the table above for the same
reason; five remain open and unblocked.

Updated 2026-08-31, fourth pass: **COMM-P05 is closed** by COMM-307
(202608310005 plus the client half in `cloud.js`). The post-class
trained-with-you card exists: `attendance_classmates_today()` answers "who else
logged a session today" from `attendance_log`, and the card in COMM-115's feed
top area renders it — or, far more often, renders nothing at all, which is the
whole design. Unlike the three closures above, this one needed both halves;
the schema half alone would not have closed it. The row stays in the table
above for the same reason; four remain open and unblocked.

Updated 2026-08-31, fifth pass: **COMM-P03 is closed** by COMM-305
(202608310007). The four `ATTENDANCE_RECORDED` achievement definitions,
seeded and disabled since Phase 0 with a comment saying enabling them later
would be an `UPDATE` rather than a migration, are enabled and earnable: a
trigger on `attendance_log` unlocks them on a real crossing, and the two count
milestones also produce the club's first ever `POST_ATTENDANCE_MILESTONE`
posts, a post type that has had an enum label and a client renderer and no
producer since COMM-001. Like COMM-306 and unlike COMM-307, this needed only
the schema half — the client renderer was already correct and renders real
data unchanged. The row stays in the table above for the same reason; three
remain open and unblocked (COMM-P04, COMM-P06, COMM-P07).

Updated 2026-09-01, sixth pass: **COMM-P04 is closed** by COMM-304
(202608310008 plus the client half in `cloud.js`). `coach_engagement_flags`
has its first producer — `coach_detect_engagement_decline()`, a scheduled
baseline-vs-recent comparison off `attendance_log` — and COMM-226's
previously flag-gated, hidden, empty Engage section is flipped default-on
with real rows, a review/dismiss write path, and a "reach out" one-tap
action. Like COMM-307 and unlike COMM-306/COMM-305, this needed both
halves. The row stays in the table above for the same reason; two remain
open and unblocked (COMM-P06, COMM-P07).

Updated 2026-09-01, seventh pass: **COMM-P06 and COMM-P07 are both closed**
by COMM-316 (202609010003 plus the Edge Function and client halves,
`cdde05c`/`b3747d2`) — the last two rows in this table. `weekly_recaps`
gains a real classmates line, gated by `recap_weekly_classmates()` written
against an explicit viewer parameter rather than the module's usual
`can_view_profile_field()` helper, since that helper cannot answer for a
service-role caller with no session; and `onboarding_progress` gains the
first- and third-class steps, ranked after the three COMM-222 steps rather
than between them. Like COMM-304/COMM-307, this needed both halves. The
row stays in the table above for the same reason. **All seven rows in the
parked bucket are now closed** — this table is complete as a historical
record.

## Phase 0 schema handoff for qa (COMM-019)

Migrations 202608280001 through 202608280013. One line per new table saying
the boundary a test has to assert. Every table below has RLS enabled and at
least one policy. A table reachable with no policy is a test failure.

Read `docs/community/contracts.md`, section "Phase 0 schema notes", first.
Two things there change what a test should expect: the posts table is
`public.workout_posts`, and community writes now require
`profiles.recovery_verified_at`, so a fixture member with a null
`recovery_verified_at` must fail every write listed as gated.

### Clubs and RBAC (202608280001)

| Table | Boundary to assert |
|---|---|
| clubs | Any authenticated member reads the one row. Only a caller whose role resolves to owner may insert, update, or delete. |
| roles | Any authenticated member reads. Only owner writes. A member cannot grant themselves a higher-ranked row. |
| permissions | Any authenticated member reads. Only owner writes. |
| role_permissions | Any authenticated member reads. Only owner writes, so a member cannot attach a permission to their own role. |

Also worth a test each, since every other policy is keyed to them:
`has_perm()` returns false for a caller with no redemption, true for the
seeded member permission. `is_staff()` and `is_admin()` still answer the same
way they did before 202608280001 for an admin, a coach, and a plain member.

### Audit log (202608280002)

| Table | Boundary to assert |
|---|---|
| admin_actions | Readable only by a `community.analytics.view` holder. No client can insert, update, or delete, admin included: there is no policy and no grant for any of the three. `log_admin_action` is not executable by `authenticated` at all. |

### Profile privacy and recovery (202608280003)

| Table | Boundary to assert |
|---|---|
| profiles (new columns) | A member updating their own row cannot change `is_admin`, `recovery_verified_at`, or `club_id`, and cannot set `recovery_verified_at` on insert either. A member with `visible_to_club` false is invisible to another member's select and still visible to themselves and to a real admin. A follow insert targeting a member with `allow_follows` false is rejected by the policy, not by the client. |

`can_view_profile_field` deserves its own test per toggle: set it as member A,
read as member B, assert the answer flips. An unknown field name must raise.
A block edge in either direction must return false before any toggle is read.

### Posts and media (202608280004, 202608280005)

| Table | Boundary to assert |
|---|---|
| workout_posts (new columns) | A `only_me` post is invisible to every member but the author. A `friends` post is visible only across a mutual follow edge, and a one-way follower must not see it. A `hidden` or `removed` status hides the post from everyone but its author and a real admin. A member with no `recovery_verified_at` cannot insert at all. |
| post_media | A fifth media row on one post fails, because `position` is bounded to 0 through 3 and (post_id, position) is unique. Read follows the parent post exactly, so a media row on an `only_me` post is invisible to a second member. Insert and update only by the post author, and only while the post is not removed. A storage path whose first segment is not the author's uid is rejected by the trigger. |

Two more assertions belong here: `add_post_comment` and `toggle_reaction`
both raise for a member without `recovery_verified_at`, and removing a
reaction you already left still works for that member.

### Feed telemetry (202608280006)

| Table | Boundary to assert |
|---|---|
| feed_impressions | Strictly own-row read and insert. A member cannot read another member's impression stream, and nobody can, admin included. No client can UPDATE, so `opened` and `engaged` cannot be rewritten after the fact. |
| feed_interactions | Strictly own-row read and insert. A batch of 20 impressions in one `feed_record_impressions` call succeeds, 51 raises, and a repeated batch does not double-count. |

### Achievements (202608280007)

| Table | Boundary to assert |
|---|---|
| achievement_definitions | Any member reads. Only a real admin inserts, updates, or deletes, so a member cannot invent or enable an achievement. The four seeded attendance definitions are present with `enabled` false. |
| member_achievements | Owner always reads their own. Another member reads a club-visible unlock only when the owner's `show_achievements` is on and no block edge sits between them. No client can insert, update, or delete: a member cannot award themselves. A second row for a non-repeatable definition fails on the partial unique index. |

### Notifications (202608280008)

| Table | Boundary to assert |
|---|---|
| notifications | Own-row read only. No client can insert, so a member cannot plant a notification in someone else's stream. The own-row update reaches `read_at` and nothing else: an attempt to change `title`, `body`, or `deep_link` silently keeps the old value. |
| notification_preferences | Own-row read and write. A missing row must behave as in_app. |
| push_subscriptions | Own-row read and write. A member cannot read another member's endpoint or keys. |

### Challenges (202608280009)

| Table | Boundary to assert |
|---|---|
| challenges | A draft is readable only by its creator and by a `community.challenge.create` holder. Create, edit, and delete require that permission, so a plain member cannot make one. |
| challenge_teams | Readable with the parent challenge. Written only by a `community.challenge.create` holder. |
| challenge_participants | Anyone reads who joined. A member inserts only their own row, only on an active challenge, and only with `recovery_verified_at` set. A member cannot join on someone else's behalf or edit another participant's row. |
| challenge_progress | Append only. Insert only your own row and only while you are an active participant. No client can update or delete, so a contribution is corrected by a compensating negative delta. |

### Events (202608280010)

| Table | Boundary to assert |
|---|---|
| events | A draft is readable only by its creator and by a `community.event.manage` holder. Create, edit, and delete require that permission. |
| event_attendees | RSVP only for yourself, only on a published event, only with `recovery_verified_at` set. An attendee who turned `show_in_attendee_lists` off is invisible to other members and still visible to themselves and to an event manager. Capacity and deadline are enforced on the direct RLS upsert as well as through `event_rsvp`, and a `going` to `going` update on a full event must still succeed. |

### Coach engagement (202608280011)

| Table | Boundary to assert |
|---|---|
| coach_engagement_flags | The single most important assertion in this list: the flagged member can never read their own row, even when that member is themselves a coach or an admin. Every policy carries `user_id <> auth.uid()` for exactly that reason. Staff read and write rows about other members. The table ships empty. |

### Analytics (202608280012)

| Table | Boundary to assert |
|---|---|
| analytics_events | Insert own-row or a null user_id. Read only by a `community.analytics.view` holder, and specifically NOT by the member who wrote the row. A `props` payload over 4 KB is rejected by the trigger. |

### Invite throttle (202608280013)

| Table | Boundary to assert |
|---|---|
| invite_attempts | Still unreachable by any client: no grant and no policy for anon or authenticated. The behaviour test is the one that matters: five wrong codes, then discard the session and sign in anonymously again with the same `actor_key`, and the sixth attempt still returns `rate_limited`. A wrong code returns the same answer and increments the same way whether the actor is new or not. |

## Phase 1 schema handoff for qa

Migrations 202608280014 through 202608280018, the five tables and two
columns Phase 0 deferred. Same rule as the Phase 0 handoff: one line per new
table saying the boundary a test has to assert, every table has RLS enabled
and at least one policy, and a table reachable with no policy is a test
failure.

Read `docs/community/contracts.md`, section "Phase 1 schema notes", first.
Three things there change what a test should expect. The comments table is
`public.post_comments`. The comment body limit is now 1000, not 280.
`posting_restrictions` and `pins` have no write grant at all, so the correct
assertion is that a direct PostgREST insert fails for everyone including an
admin, and the permission check lives in the function.

### Hidden and saved posts (202608280014)

| Table | Boundary to assert |
|---|---|
| hidden_posts | Strictly own-row on select, insert, and delete. Member B can never read, count, or infer member A's hides, so a hide is invisible to the post author. There is no UPDATE grant and no update policy. An insert naming another member's user_id fails, and an insert for a post the caller cannot see fails on `post_visible_to_viewer`, which is what stops it being an existence oracle for an `only_me` post. A member with a null `recovery_verified_at` cannot insert. |
| saved_posts | Same four assertions as hidden_posts. Additionally, a repeat save collides on the `(user_id, post_id)` primary key rather than creating a second row. |

### Posting restrictions (202608280015)

| Table | Boundary to assert |
|---|---|
| posting_restrictions | No client can insert, update, or delete, a `community.member.restrict` holder included: there is no policy and no grant for any of the three. A member reads their own restrictions and nobody else's unless they hold `community.member.restrict` or `community.comment.moderate`. A temporary row with a null `expires_at` fails the CHECK, and so does a permanent row with one. |

Four behaviour assertions belong here and matter more than the table shape.
A restricted member's `workout_posts` insert is refused by
`posts_insert_self`. Their `add_post_comment` raises `posting_restricted`.
Their `comment_edit` raises the same, so an old comment cannot be rewritten
into new content. A restriction whose `expires_at` has passed stops
applying with no cron run and no backfill, because expiry is evaluated at
read time. One more: `is_posting_restricted(<someone else>)` must raise for
a plain member and answer for a moderator.

`mod_restrict_member` and `mod_lift_restriction` each need a test that the
matching `admin_actions` row exists after the call, since that is the whole
reason the table has no write grant.

### Comment threads (202608280016)

| Table | Boundary to assert |
|---|---|
| post_comments (new columns) | Reply depth is capped at 2 in both directions. A reply to a reply fails. Giving a parent to a comment that already has replies fails, which is the UPDATE path that would otherwise create depth 3. A reply whose parent sits on another post fails. A removed or soft-deleted comment is invisible to every member but its author and a `community.comment.moderate` holder, and the reply that pointed at it is still returned with its `parent_comment_id` intact so the client can render the placeholder. A 1000-character body is accepted and a 1001-character one is truncated by the function, not rejected. There is still no INSERT and no UPDATE grant, so a direct `.insert()` or `.update()` on the table fails for everyone. |

`comment_edit` needs its own three: a non-author is refused, the author's
edit always stamps `edited_at`, and an all-whitespace body raises. The
two-argument `add_post_comment` must still resolve and still behave exactly
as it did, which is the regression that would break the current client.

### Pins (202608280017)

| Table | Boundary to assert |
|---|---|
| pins | Any signed-in member reads. No client can insert, update, or delete, a `community.content.pin` holder included: select is the only policy and the only grant. A fourth `pin_set` raises `pin_limit_reached`. `pin_set` and `pin_clear` both refuse a caller without `community.content.pin` and both write an `admin_actions` row. Pinning a deleted post, a removed post, a cancelled event, or an archived challenge raises. Soft-deleting or removing a pinned target auto-unpins it and frees the slot, and that auto-unpin writes no audit row. |

The concurrency assertion is worth one test even though it is awkward: two
`pin_set` calls racing for the last slot must produce one success and one
`pin_limit_reached`, never two rows in the same slot.

### Notification batches (202608280018)

| Table | Boundary to assert |
|---|---|
| notification_batches | Own-row read only. No client can insert, update, or delete, which is the assertion that matters: a member who could write here would set their own `next_flush_at` to now and turn the batched channel back into a stream of pings. A second `notif_queue_batched` for the same member, category, and type increments the counter in place rather than adding a row, and does not move `next_flush_at`. A queue call on an empty batch does start a fresh window. `notification_batch_window()` returns 6 hours and matches the column default. |

### Achievement claim and seed (202608280020)

One new type, one new function, no new table.

| Function or data | Boundary to assert |
|---|---|
| ach_claim(p_codes text[]) | Writes `user_id` from `auth.uid()` only, never from the payload. A null or empty array returns nothing and raises nothing. 51 codes raises. A code whose definition is disabled, is `ATTENDANCE_RECORDED`, or lacks `config->>'client_claimable' = 'true'` is absent from the result and writes no row, and it is ignored rather than raised alongside a valid code in the same array. A second claim of a non-repeatable code returns nothing the second time. A member with a null `recovery_verified_at` raises `recovery method required`. The 31st call in 10 minutes raises `rate_limited`. **202608290002:** for any accepted code whose `config->>'metric' = 'tenure_days'` (the four `anniversary_year_*` rows), the claim is additionally, independently verified against `invite_redemptions.redeemed_at` — a member short of the day threshold gets no row for that code even though the definition is `client_claimable`, a redemption exactly on the threshold already qualifies, and every non-tenure `client_claimable` metric is unaffected. |
| achievement_definitions seed | 27 non-attendance rows are present and enabled. Every `community` and `challenge` category row, and every `club` category row except the four `anniversary_year_*` rows, has no `client_claimable` key, so `ach_claim` refuses it: this is the assertion that keeps a gameable count off the client path. The four `anniversary_year_*` rows ARE seeded `client_claimable: true`, gated instead by the independent tenure check above. The four attendance rows are still present, still `enabled = false`, and untouched by the seed. Re-running the seed changes no row count. |

### ach_claim tenure verification (202608290002)

No new table. `create or replace` of `ach_claim`, same signature.

| Function | Boundary to assert |
|---|---|
| ach_claim(p_codes text[]) | Closes a gaming gap found while writing 0020's pgTAP coverage: the four club-category `anniversary_year_*` rows are `client_claimable: true` like every other client-detected milestone, but membership tenure, unlike session/PR/streak/Rx counts, is derivable from `invite_redemptions.redeemed_at`, a server-set timestamp the client cannot write. A member whose redemption is younger than the code's `threshold` days gets no row for a `tenure_days`-metered code, even though the definition is client-claimable. A redemption exactly `threshold` days old (the `<=` boundary) already qualifies. The check is keyed on `config->>'metric' = 'tenure_days'`, not on the code, so it covers any future tenure-metered definition automatically. |

### Comment mentions and self-delete (202608280021)

| Table | Boundary to assert |
|---|---|
| comment_mentions | Select is the only grant and the only policy: a direct insert, update, or delete fails for everyone, an author and a moderator included. A member reads a row only when they are the mentioned user or the comment author. A third member who can read the comment still reads no mention rows for it, which is the leak that matters. |

Four behaviour assertions on the four-argument `add_post_comment`. A target
with `allow_mentions` off gets no row while the comment itself still lands.
A target behind a block edge in either direction gets no row. Self-mention
and duplicate ids write nothing extra. Eleven mentions raises. The two- and
three-argument forms must still resolve and behave exactly as before, which
is the regression that would break the current client.

`comment_delete` needs three: a non-author is refused, the author's call
sets `status`, `deleted_at`, and `deleted_by` together, and a second call on
an already-removed comment is a silent no-op that does not overwrite a
moderator's `deleted_by`. One more that matters more than the shape: the
soft-deleted comment drops out of `post_comments_visible` for everyone but
its author and a `community.comment.moderate` holder, and its replies are
still returned with `parent_comment_id` intact.

### Profile view and decorative media (202608280022)

No new table. One new column and one new function.

| Function or column | Boundary to assert |
|---|---|
| community_profile(user_id uuid) | A fully private target (`visible_to_club` off) returns name, role, and member since and nothing else, and specifically no `posts`, `prs`, `achievements`, or counts. A target with `show_prs` off omits the `prs` key entirely rather than returning an empty array, and with it on and no PRs returns `[]`: hidden and empty must stay distinguishable. Same for `achievements`. A block edge in either direction raises `not authorized` rather than returning the header. A deleted target raises `profile not found`. The `posts` array never contains an only_me or friends post the caller cannot see, and `result_text` plus the numeric `metadata` keys are stripped when `show_workout_results` is off. An anonymous or signed-out caller raises. |
| post_media.decorative | Defaults false, so every existing row is unchanged. An insert marked decorative with alt text stores a null `alt_text`, and so does an insert with whitespace-only alt text. Updating a row to decorative clears its alt text in the same statement. |

### Post create (202608280023)

No new table. One new function, `post_create(text, post_visibility, jsonb,
jsonb)`, which closes the composer's end-to-end break.

| Function | Boundary to assert |
|---|---|
| post_create(body, visibility, media, links) | A null caller raises `not authorized`; a caller without `community.post.create` raises `not authorized`; a member with a null `recovery_verified_at` raises `recovery method required`; a member with an active `posting_restrictions` row raises `posting_restricted`, and that check runs before the rate limit so a restricted member burns no budget; the 21st call in 10 minutes raises `rate_limited`. An empty body with empty `media` raises. A `media` array of 5 raises; each item needs a `storage_path`. A media `storage_path` whose first path segment is not the caller's uid is rejected by `enforce_post_media_ownership` and the whole call rolls back, post row included. A decorative item stores a null `alt_text` (the `post_media_normalize_alt` trigger). `post_type` is `POST_PHOTO` only when there is media and no text, else `POST_TEXT`. `visibility` round-trips `club`, `friends`, `only_me`. The row and its `post_media` rows either all land or none do. |

### Reports target and status (202608280024)

No new table. New columns on `reports`, a wider `reason` CHECK, a swapped
unique key, and a new `report_status` label.

| Column or constraint | Boundary to assert |
|---|---|
| reports.target_type, reports.target_id | `target_type` is `post` or `comment`; anything else fails the CHECK. `target_id` is NOT NULL. Every pre-existing row has `target_type = 'post'` and `target_id = post_id`. `post_id` is now nullable and a `comment` report written through `report()` leaves it null, which is what keeps `feed_page`'s reporter self-hide (keyed to `post_id`) from hiding the post a comment sits on. |
| reports unique key | `(reporter_id, target_type, target_id)` is unique; the old `(reporter_id, post_id)` is gone. A second `report()` by the same reporter on the same target updates the row rather than inserting a second one. |
| reports.review_note | Defaults `''`, capped at 500 chars, separate from `details` (the reporter's own note). |
| report_status | `action_taken` is a valid label; `resolved` is still present and no row was remapped. |

### Moderation reshape (202608280025)

One new composite type `mod_queue_item`, and the functions `report`,
`submit_report` (rewritten as a wrapper), `post_delete`, `comment_moderate`,
`mod_queue`, `mod_review`, `admin_grant_coach(uuid, text)`, plus rewrites of
`admin_grant_coach(uuid)` and `admin_revoke_coach`.

| Function | Boundary to assert |
|---|---|
| report(p_target_type, p_target_id, p_reason, p_note) | Requires `is_community_member()`. Unknown `p_target_type` or `p_reason` raises. Rate limited at 10 per 10 minutes. A post target sets `post_id = target_id`; a comment target leaves `post_id` null. A duplicate by the same reporter on the same target refreshes `reason` and `details` and does not add a row or move the distinct-reporter count or reopen `status`. `submit_report(post_id, reason)` still resolves and routes here. |
| post_delete(post_id) | The author always. A non-author only with `community.post.delete_any` OR `community.comment.moderate` OR real `is_admin`; anyone else raises. Sets `deleted_at` and status `removed`, idempotent on a second call. A moderator removal writes one `content_delete` audit row; an author removing their own post writes none. |
| comment_moderate(p_comment_id, p_action) | Requires `community.comment.moderate` OR real `is_admin`. `remove` sets status `removed`, `deleted_at`, and `deleted_by = auth.uid()`; `restore` clears all three. An unknown action raises. Idempotent: a second `remove` returns before touching `deleted_by`, so it never overwrites a self-delete stamp and a self-delete never overwrites it. Each call writes one `content_delete` audit row, target_type `comment`. |
| mod_queue(p_status, p_cursor, p_limit) | Requires `community.comment.moderate` OR real `is_admin`; a plain member raises `not authorized`. One row per `(target_type, target_id)`. `reporter_count` is distinct reporters, `reasons` is the distinct set, `status` is `open` if any report is open then `reviewing` then `dismissed` then `action_taken`. `p_status = 'all'` returns every group; `p_limit` clamps to 1..50. `reporters` jsonb carries `{id, name}` and is only ever returned here. |
| mod_review(p_report_id, p_decision, p_note, p_expires_at) | Requires `community.comment.moderate` OR real `is_admin`. `remove` on a post routes through `post_delete`, on a comment through `comment_moderate('remove')`, so a remove leaves two audit rows (`content_delete` + `report_review`). `restrict_temp` / `restrict_permanent` route through `mod_restrict_member` against the content author, which itself needs `community.member.restrict`, so a `comment.moderate`-only caller can pick them and the call then raises. Every decision stamps every `reports` row for the target with `reviewed_by`, `reviewed_at`, `review_note`, sets `status` to `dismissed` for `dismiss` and `action_taken` otherwise, and writes one `report_review` audit row (`before {status}`, `after {status, decision}`). `p_expires_at` is read only for `restrict_temp`. |
| admin_grant_coach(uuid, text) / admin_grant_coach(uuid) / admin_revoke_coach(uuid) | Real `is_admin` inline. The two-argument form takes `p_role` in `coach` or `head_coach` only; `staff`, `owner`, or anything else raises. The one-argument form still resolves (no default on the two-argument `p_role`, so `admin_grant_coach(uuid)` is not ambiguous) and grants `coach`. Every grant and revoke writes one `role_change` audit row, target_type `member`, `before {role: <prior>}`, `after {role: <new>}`. A revoke of someone already `member` writes nothing. |

### Notification create path (202608280026)

No new table. One column `announcements.important`, `notif_create`, and the
helpers `notif_dedupe_window`, `notif_pref_key`, `notif_pref_allows`,
`notif_blocked_between`, `notif_is_operational`. Also re-creates
`notifications_deep_link_check` with a `{0,255}` regex bound (the
`{0,300}` original raised `invalid repetition count(s)` on every insert
with a non-null `deep_link`).

| Function or column | Boundary to assert |
|---|---|
| notif_create(...) | No client can call it: `revoke execute` from public, anon, and authenticated, no grant to anyone, so a PostgREST RPC to `notif_create` fails for a member, a coach, and an admin alike. Its effects are only observable through the trigger set. Returns NULL and writes nothing when recipient == actor (except `achievement_unlocked` / `weekly_recap`), when a block edge sits either way, when the recipient has an `off` preference on the mapped key and the row is not operational, or when an identical `(user_id, type, source_id)` row exists inside `notif_dedupe_window()`. Truncates title to 160 and body to 500. |
| notif_dedupe_window() | Immutable, returns `1 hour`, granted to `authenticated`. |
| announcements.important | Defaults false. Only `is_staff()` can set it (the existing `announcements_insert_admin` / `announcements_update_admin` policies). A member cannot flip it. |
| notifications_deep_link_check | A row with `deep_link = '/community/feed?post=<uuid>&comment=<uuid>'` inserts (via a trigger) without raising; a `deep_link` not starting with `/` still fails the CHECK. |

### Notification trigger set (202608280027)

No new table. Five AFTER INSERT / UPDATE triggers plus
`notif_announcement_fanout`. All trigger functions are `revoke execute`
from every client role.

| Trigger | Boundary to assert |
|---|---|
| notif_on_comment (post_comments) | A first comment by member X on Y's post writes one immediate `comment_on_post` for Y. A second comment by X on the same post writes no `notifications` row and increments `comment_also` in Y's `community` batch in place. A reply writes one `comment_reply` for the parent author (unless that is the replier). X commenting on X's own post writes nothing. A block edge between X and Y suppresses both the immediate row and the batch enqueue. |
| notif_on_mention (comment_mentions) | Fires on `comment_mentions`, never on `post_comments`: a bare comment with an `@name` string in the body but no accepted `comment_mentions` row produces no `mention` notification. One row per accepted mention. `coach_mention` when the comment author holds `coach` or `head_coach`, else `mention`. A target with `mentions` preference `off`, or a block edge, gets nothing. |
| notif_on_reaction (reactions) | Never writes an immediate `notifications` row. Increments `reaction` in the post author's `community` batch when author `<> NEW.user_id`, no block edge, and the author's `reactions` preference is not `off`. A reaction on your own post does nothing. |
| notif_on_announcement (announcements) | A normal announcement writes one immediate `announcement` row for every club member except the author whose `announcements` preference is not `off`. An `important` announcement reaches every member including those with the preference `off`. Flipping `important` false -> true fans out only to members with an explicit `off` row, so no member ever gets two rows for one announcement. The deep link is `/community/feed?announcement=<id>`. |
| notif_on_achievement (member_achievements) | A `member_achievements` insert for member U writes one immediate `achievement_unlocked` for U (recipient == actor is allowed for this type). Each member in a mutual-follow edge with U, with U's `visible_to_club` and `show_achievements` on, `NEW.visibility <> 'only_me'`, no block edge, and `friend_achievements` not `off`, gets a `friend_achievement` entry in their `training` batch. `only_me` visibility fans out to nobody. |

### Notification batch flusher (202608280028)

No new table. `notif_batch_flush_due` and `notif_category_surface`.

| Function | Boundary to assert |
|---|---|
| notif_batch_flush_due(p_limit) | Granted to `service_role` only: no client can call it. Processes only `notification_batches` rows with `next_flush_at <= now()` and `pending_count > 0`. Writes one `notifications` row per key in `pending`, using the batched type key as `notifications.type`, then calls `notif_batch_flushed` so the row's `pending_count` returns to 0. Deep link is `/community/feed?post=<last_source_id>` only when that type is the whole batch and is `reaction` or `comment_also`, otherwise the category surface. Returns the count of rows written. A second call with nothing due returns 0 and writes nothing. NOTE: nothing schedules this yet - a pg_cron entry or scheduled Edge Function is still needed for batched notifications to be delivered. |

## Phase 2 schema handoff for qa

Same rule as every prior handoff: one line per table/function/trigger saying
the boundary a test has to assert.

### Challenges (202608290003 through 202608290006)

No new table - four columns added to `challenge_progress` and `challenges`,
one composite type, one read function, two triggers on `challenge_progress`,
one write RPC, one service-role RPC, two triggers on `challenge_participants`.
Originally verified only locally (`supabase db reset` plus manual psql smoke
tests) when this migration landed, with no committed, CI-running pgTAP file -
a real gap COMM-234's sweep found and closed:
`supabase/tests/0035_challenge_progress_notifications_test.sql` (39
assertions) now runs every boundary below for real on every
`migration-check`, including the COMM-208 routing rows this table exists to
pin. One item below is still genuinely open, not silently claimed: the
`team_id` snapshot's "still counts after leaving" case (a participant
delete plus a re-read) - flagged again for a future run, not attempted here
either.

| Function / trigger / column | Boundary to assert |
|---|---|
| chal_progress(challenge_id) | Raises `not authorized` for a null caller and for a caller with no live role. Raises `challenge not found` for a `draft` challenge read by anyone but its creator or a `community.challenge.create` holder (verified: the creating coach CAN read their own draft). Returns the right non-null fields per `challenge_type` and leaves every non-applicable field null (verified all five types: individual_target, cooperative, team, coach, individual_performance). A non-participant reading a challenge they never joined gets `my_progress`/`my_status` null, not zero/'active', with every other field intact. |
| challenge_progress_apply (AFTER INSERT on challenge_progress) | Sums `delta` into the matching `challenge_participants.progress_value` (verified: 60 then +50 on a target of 100 reaches 110). Flips `individual_target`/`individual_performance` to `completed` with `completed_at` set exactly the first time the total reaches `target_value`, and a later negative correction (verified: -80 after completion) leaves `status = 'completed'` and only lowers `progress_value`. |
| challenge_progress_apply, cooperative milestone | For a `cooperative` challenge, posts one authorless (`author_id is null`) `POST_CHALLENGE` `workout_posts` row the first time `club_total` reaches each of 25/50/75/100 percent of `target_value`, never a repeat post for a threshold already crossed (verified: a later contribution that keeps the total above 50% does not produce a second 50% post), and a single contribution that crosses two thresholds at once (verified: 65% -> 105%) posts both 75% and 100% in the same transaction. |
| challenge_progress.team_id, challenge_progress_stamp_team (BEFORE INSERT) | Snapshots the contributor's current `challenge_participants.team_id` onto the progress row at insert time; `chal_progress`'s `team_totals` sums from this column, not from the live participant row, so a departed member's earlier contributions keep counting for their old team (not independently re-verified this run past the trigger firing correctly - the "still counts after leaving" case needs a participant delete plus a re-read, flagged for qa to cover explicitly). |
| challenge_progress.entered_by / note, challenge_progress_insert_self (re-created) | A self-insert with `entered_by` set to any uuid is rejected by RLS (verified: `entered_by = <coach>` on an m1 self-insert raises "new row violates row-level security policy"). A plain self-insert with no `entered_by` still succeeds. |
| chal_record_progress(p_challenge_id, p_user_id, p_delta, p_note) | Raises `not authorized` for a caller without `community.challenge.create` (verified: m1 targeting m2). Raises `not an active participant` for a target with no active `challenge_participants` row on that challenge (verified: coach targeting m3, who never joined). A holder targeting an active participant writes one `challenge_progress` row with `source_type = 'coach_entry'` and `entered_by` the caller (verified, then confirmed `challenge_progress_apply` applies it exactly like a self-insert). |
| challenges.ending_soon_notified_at, chal_notify_ending_soon() | Granted to `service_role` only (verified: `authenticated` gets "permission denied for function"). Selects only `active` challenges ending within 48 hours with the column still null, `notif_create`s every active participant, stamps the column. A second call after stamping is a no-op (verified: returns 0, writes nothing). |
| notif_on_challenge_join (AFTER INSERT on challenge_participants) | Enqueues batched `challenge_update` for every other active participant on the same challenge, never the joiner, never immediate (verified across 10 joins spanning 5 challenges: exact per-recipient counts matched hand-tallied expectations). |
| notif_on_challenge_complete (AFTER UPDATE OF status on challenge_participants) | Enqueues the same batched fan-out only on a genuine transition into `completed` (guards against the trigger firing on every `challenge_progress_apply` UPDATE, which always touches the `status` column even when unchanged), never to the completer (verified: m1 completing did not add to m1's own batch, only to m2's). |

### Realtime publication and community_search (202608290007, 202608290008)

No new table - a publication membership change plus one new read function.
`test/community-realtime-search-rls.test.mjs` pins the static half (grant
list, security definer shape, the exact predicate mirrored from each source
policy). The runtime half below was originally only verified locally by
hand, with its own text here noting "this is where a pgTAP suite covering
the runtime half belongs next" - COMM-234's sweep added that suite:
`supabase/tests/0036_realtime_and_search_runtime_test.sql` (17 assertions),
run for real by `migration-check` from here on.

| Function / migration | Boundary to assert |
|---|---|
| supabase_realtime publication (202608290007) | `select * from pg_publication_tables where pubname = 'supabase_realtime'` contains exactly `challenge_progress`, `challenge_participants`, `post_comments`, `reactions`, `notifications` (verified: all five present, nothing else added by this migration). |
| community_search(p_query, p_limit) | Granted to `authenticated` only (verified: `anon` role gets "permission denied for function"). Raises `not authorized` for a null caller (verified: `authenticated` role with no `request.jwt.claim.sub` set). |
| community_search, sub-2-char threshold | A 1-character or empty (after `%_,()` stripping) query returns `{members: [], events: [], challenges: []}` with no table read, not an error (verified: `'S'` and `'%_,()'` alone both short-circuit). |
| community_search, sanitization | A query built only from `%`, `_`, `,`, `(`, `)` strips to empty and short-circuits rather than wildcard-matching every row (verified: `'%_,()Zzz'` correctly matches only titles containing `Zzz`, not every row). |
| community_search, members group | Mirrors `profiles_read_authenticated` exactly: excludes the caller's own row (verified), excludes a member with `visible_to_club = false` from a non-admin caller (verified: fixture `SearchHidden Member` invisible to m1), excludes a member on either side of a `blocks` row (verified: m3 blocking m1 hides m1 from m3's search and vice versa). |
| community_search, events group | A `draft` event is invisible to a caller who is neither its creator nor a `community.event.manage` holder (verified: m2 searching does not see m1's draft), visible to its creator (verified: m1 sees its own draft) and to a manage-permission holder who did not create it (verified: coach sees m1's draft). Non-draft statuses (`published`, `cancelled`, `past`) are visible to everyone regardless of creator, matching `events_read`'s actual `status <> 'draft'` predicate rather than a narrower "published only" reading. |
| community_search, challenges group | Same shape as events, verified against `challenges_read`'s `community.challenge.create` permission: a `draft` challenge is invisible to a non-creator without that permission, visible to its creator, and visible to a permission holder who did not create it. |
| community_search, p_limit | Each group is capped independently by the clamped `p_limit` (verified: `p_limit = 1` against two matching challenges returns exactly one). |

### Announcements, recaps, coach-tools, new-member post, and leaderboards (202608290010, 011, 013, 014, 015)

Unlike every table/function above, these five migrations' own pgTAP files
(`supabase/tests/0030` through `0034`) were written and committed alongside
each cluster's schema commit, not left as a follow-up - the note here is
purely that this handoff section itself never listed them, which is a real
documentation gap COMM-234's sweep is closing, not a test gap: `npx supabase
test db` already runs all five, 884 assertions total before this sweep's own
0035/0036 additions. One line per new table, same rule as every other
handoff above.

| Table / function | Boundary asserted (see the named file for the executing detail) |
|---|---|
| announcements.priority / expires_at (202608290010) | `0030_announcement_priority_expiry_test.sql`: only `is_staff()` sets priority or expiry; an expired announcement drops out of `announcements_read` at read time, no cron; the `important` mirror trigger keeps firing off the 3-tier value so the Phase 1 escalation trigger needs no edit. |
| weekly_recaps (202608290011) | `0031_recaps_and_onboarding_test.sql`: own-row read only, zero client write grant of any kind including the owning member - only `service_role` (the Edge Function, bypassing RLS) writes; the `(user_id, week_start)` unique key both rejects a duplicate and carries `recap_weekly`'s upsert idempotency; `week_start` is CHECK'd to a Monday. |
| onboarding_progress (202608290011) | `0031_recaps_and_onboarding_test.sql`: seeded only by the `invite_redemptions` AFTER INSERT trigger, never by a client insert; own-row read and update; a stamp is one-way (a clear or a re-stamp is a silent no-op, not an error); a redemption UPDATE (coach grant) does not re-seed or reset it. |
| coach_celebrate_feed(), coach_assign_coach(), member_contact_log (202608290013) | `0032_coach_tools_test.sql`: `coach_celebrate_feed` and `coach_assign_coach` both require real staff, inline; `member_contact_log` is staff-read-any, staff-write-own-name only (`contacted_by = auth.uid()`), no member-facing read at all, deliberately no `user_id <> auth.uid()` clause since "someone said hello to you" is not the sensitive signal `coach_engagement_flags` protects against. |
| POST_NEW_MEMBER trigger (202608290014) | `0033_new_member_post_test.sql`: fires on `invite_redemptions` INSERT alongside `seed_onboarding_progress` (both triggers on the same table fire together), authorless, honestly omits `member_name` when no profile exists yet at trigger time rather than placeholder-filling it. |
| leaderboard_row, feed_leaderboard(), people_suggestions() (202608290015) | `0034_feed_leaderboard_and_suggestions_test.sql`: every ranked/suggested member passes `can_view_profile_field` for the relevant toggle (which also settles block edges); `consistency_week_streaks()` is pinned to agree with `community_profile`'s own inline streak arithmetic so the two cannot drift; ties are fully broken so `rank` is a real position; the caller's own row always returns even when it fell outside `p_limit`. |

## Phase 3 schema handoff for qa

Same rule as every prior handoff: one line per table/function/trigger saying
the boundary a test has to assert. Unlike the Phase 2 sections above, every
line here is already covered by a committed, CI-running pgTAP file written
alongside the migration, not left as a follow-up — the convention 0030-0034
set and COMM-234's sweep argued for.

### Attendance log (202608310001, COMM-300)

One new table, two helper functions, one trigger on the existing
`private_records` table, and a one-time backfill.
`supabase/tests/0037_attendance_log_test.sql` (54 assertions) runs every
boundary below on `migration-check`, including the three the ticket named
explicitly for qa. `test/community-attendance-log-rls.test.mjs` (22 tests)
pins the static SQL shape and executes the client half in jsdom.

Three things differ from COMM-300's own migration outline, all deliberate,
none of them narrowing what the ticket promised:

1. **Two helper functions the outline did not name.**
   `attendance_session_record_types()` and `attendance_parse_day()`. The
   first keeps the session-bearing set in one place; the second is the
   null-on-anything-bad payload date parser. A downstream Phase 3 ticket
   should reuse both rather than re-deriving either.
2. **The future-date rule resolved to refuse, never clamp**, with one day of
   slack. Reasoning in the table below.
3. **The migration backfills existing `private_records`.** Not in the
   outline. Without it every member's attendance history would start at zero
   on deploy day and COMM-306's board would read a club that has apparently
   never trained. It is also strictly safer now than later: COMM-305 adds an
   AFTER INSERT trigger on this table that mints achievements and posts
   milestones, and that trigger does not exist yet.

| Table / function / trigger | Boundary to assert |
|---|---|
| attendance_log (table) | One row per `(user_id, occurred_on)`, enforced by a unique constraint rather than a counting trigger. `user_id` cascades from `profiles`. `source_record_type`/`source_record_id` are nullable provenance and deliberately not a foreign key — the `private_records` row they name may be deleted later without touching the attendance day, so nothing may join on them. |
| attendance_log, no client write | `authenticated` has `select` and nothing else; `anon` has nothing. There is no insert, update, or delete policy for any role — not one (asserted by counting `pg_policies` rows with `cmd <> 'SELECT'`, so a later addition fails rather than slipping in). A plain member and an admin both get 42501 inserting their own row, and nobody can delete a day. This is the boundary the whole ticket rests on: COMM-304's flags, COMM-305's achievements and COMM-306's board would all be forgeable if a member could write here. |
| attendance_log, who can read | Own-row for `authenticated` (`attendance_log_self_select`), any row for a `community.analytics.view` holder or `is_staff()` (`attendance_log_staff_select`), verified for real with a coach and an admin reading another member's rows and a plain member seeing only their own. Deliberately **not** gated on `can_view_profile_field(user_id, 'show_attendance')` — that toggle is member-to-member, and every member-facing Phase 3 reader (COMM-302, COMM-306, COMM-307) must apply it in its own body. |
| attendance_session_record_types() | Returns exactly `{strength_entry, wod_entry}`. `bodyweight`, `measurement`, `measure_type`, `movement`, `custom_wod` and `session_note` are not in it, and the pgTAP file syncs one of every one of those with a well-formed `date` to prove none produces a day: the filter is on `record_type`, not on having a date. `session_note` is excluded additionally because nothing in app.js writes it. |
| attendance_parse_day(p_raw) | Accepts exactly `^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$` plus a successful cast — the same shape `cleanISODate()` in `src/sanitize.js` guarantees. Returns null, never raises, for a missing, null, malformed, or **impossible-but-well-shaped** date (`'2026-13-45'` matches the regex and raises 22008 on a bare cast; a hand-crafted request can send it, since `private_records` takes a direct RLS insert). Nothing on this path may throw: `flushOutbox()` only deletes an outbox row after a successful upsert, so a raise would wedge that record in the member's offline outbox forever. |
| private_records_attendance_log (AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE on private_records) | **The three boundaries COMM-300 named for qa**: two different session types on the same calendar day produce exactly one row (verified, and `on conflict do nothing` keeps the first record's provenance rather than overwriting it); two different days produce two; `bodyweight` and `measurement` produce none. Plus: INSERT **OR UPDATE**, not INSERT-only, because `flushOutbox()` upserts and a record that already exists server-side arrives as an UPDATE — verified by un-deleting a record and watching the day appear. |
| private_records_attendance_log, append-only | A soft-delete of the record that first claimed a day leaves the day standing; soft-deleting every session record a member has still leaves every day. A record that arrives already soft-deleted creates no day (the `deleted_at is null` WHEN clause). The trigger body contains no DELETE and no UPDATE at all. Same "correct forward, not backward" precedent `challenge_progress` set in 202608280009. |
| private_records_attendance_log, future dates | An entry dated 30 days out produces no row — **refused, not clamped**. Clamping to today would have invented a training day the member never claimed, permanently, because the table is append-only. The refusal is of the attendance row, not of the transaction: a member with a broken clock loses the credit for that entry, not the ability to sync. One day of slack is deliberate and load-bearing: `current_date` is the server's UTC day and the client writes a local calendar day, so an Asia/Jerusalem member training at 01:00 legitimately logs "tomorrow" in UTC — zero slack would silently drop those entries every night. Today and today+1 are accepted, today+30 is not. |
| private_records_attendance_log, missing profile | `private_records.user_id` references `auth.users`; `attendance_log.user_id` references `profiles`. A member inside the COMM-016 gate window can legally hold private records with no profile row, so the trigger skips rather than hitting a foreign key violation that would break their sync. Not independently exercised in 0037 (the fixtures all have profiles) — flagged for qa as the one branch covered by reasoning rather than by an executing assertion. |
| attendance_log_from_record(), reachability | Revoked from `public`, `anon` and `authenticated` — reachable as a trigger and nowhere else. `prosecdef` is true. It carries no `auth.uid()` check, the same documented exception `notif_queue_batched()`, `seed_onboarding_progress()` and `post_new_member_on_join()` already record: it acts on the row being inserted, which RLS already pinned to the caller, and an `auth.uid()` gate would break the backfill and any future service-role repair. |
| Backfill (202608310001) | A no-op on a fresh reset (0037 asserts the table starts empty, so every count in that file is about the trigger). Verified by hand against a seeded database with the trigger temporarily disabled: dedupes two records on the same day to one row keyed to the earliest `created_at`, skips soft-deleted rows, skips `bodyweight`, skips an impossible date, skips a future date. |
| ATTENDANCE_RECORDED emit + attendance_recorded analytics | `test/community-attendance-log-rls.test.mjs`, executing in jsdom: `flushOutbox()` emits `{occurred_on}` and nothing else after a successful write; one emit per calendar day across four records spanning two days; nothing for a `bodyweight`, `measurement`, `movement` or soft-delete; nothing when the write fails; nothing for a malformed local date. The bridge writes `attendance_recorded` with `occurred_on` only, dropping a title, a result string and a record id attached by a hypothetical future producer. It counts toward WCAM, and `metrics.md`'s rollup query agrees (pinned by `test/platform-analytics.test.mjs`). **The emit is a courtesy** — the trigger writes the table independently, so a member on an older cached build produces the row with no event, and nothing downstream may depend on it firing. |

### Relationship score (202608310002, COMM-301)

No new table, so no new RLS policy: one new internal function and one
existing function re-created around it.
`supabase/tests/0038_relationship_score_test.sql` (26 assertions) runs every
boundary below on `migration-check`. There is no client half — no new call,
no changed signature, nothing for a `.test.mjs` file to cover, and the node
suite is unchanged at 791/790 pass/1 skip.

**The load-bearing assertion in this file is not about the new function.** It
is the regression pin: three fixture posts, identical in every scored respect
except who wrote them, ranked by `feed_page` with their `feed_score` asserted
to six decimal places against literals captured by running that exact fixture
against the *pre*-refactor function. `now()` is fixed for the transaction and
the posts are published at `now() - 5 hours`, so the recency term is
`40 * 0.5^(5/36)` exactly and every number is reproducible rather than
approximate. Any arithmetic that moved anywhere in the scoring pass moves
those three numbers.

Two things differ from COMM-301's own migration outline, both so the
extraction stays behaviour-preserving, neither of them changing a number:

1. **A third, defaulted `p_as_of timestamptz` parameter.** The outline named
   `relationship_score(p_viewer, p_other)`. The inline version measured its
   30-day window from `feed_page`'s frozen `v_anchor`, not from `now()`, and
   that is the mechanism that makes every page of one feed session score
   identically. A two-argument function reading `now()` internally would put
   the window boundary a few minutes further along on page 2 than on page 1,
   so it would not have been a pure extraction. The default means the
   promised two-argument call form still resolves verbatim.
2. **The mutual-follow test is written out rather than delegated to
   `are_friends()`**, which resolves its viewer from `auth.uid()` and cannot
   answer for an arbitrary `p_viewer`. It is `are_friends()`'s body with
   `auth.uid()` replaced by `p_viewer`. Covered by a drift assertion below.

| Table / function / trigger | Boundary to assert |
|---|---|
| relationship_score(), reachability | Revoked from `public`, `anon` **and** `authenticated`, `prosecdef` false. Internal plumbing, not a second API surface — the same shape `consistency_week_streaks()` (202608290015) established. A real authenticated caller reaching for it gets 42501 from the grant, not from a check inside the body, which is deliberate: the `auth.uid()` gate belongs on the definer entry point that calls it, not on a helper with no caller of its own. The revoke of `public` is asserted separately, because a new function starts with `execute` granted to `PUBLIC` and forgetting that one line is how an internal helper quietly becomes reachable. |
| relationship_score(), the three branches | Mutual follow 1.0, one-way follow 0.55, a reaction or comment by the viewer on the other member's posts inside 30 days adds 0.45, sum capped at 1. Each asserted on its own fixture pair. The interaction signal is deliberately sourced from a post 200 days old — outside `feed_page`'s 90-day candidate window — so the reaction cannot also raise a candidate's engagement component and break the "identical except for the author" property the regression pin rests on. |
| relationship_score(), the cap | 0.55 + 0.45 is exactly 1.00, not 1.00-and-a-bit: a member the viewer follows *and* has reacted to reaches the same ceiling as a mutual follow, and in the feed the two rows tie to the last decimal with the tie falling to `published_at` then `id`. This is the boundary a "capped at 1 before its weight applies" rule actually means, and it is the one an inline-to-function move is most likely to lose. |
| relationship_score() vs are_friends() | **The drift pin for the second copy of the friends rule.** For every fixture member other than the viewer, `are_friends(id)` and `relationship_score(viewer, id) >= 1.0` must agree — asserted as an `is_empty` over the disagreements, with an `isnt_empty` alongside it so a fixture with no mutual follow in it cannot pass vacuously. Includes the self case: a member scored against themselves is 0, because `p_other <> p_viewer` is `are_friends()`'s own self-exclusion, kept. |
| relationship_score(), p_as_of | The window anchor is real, not decoration: a comment 40 days old scores 0 measured from `now()` and 0.45 measured from an anchor 15 days back. This is also the assertion that proves the comment branch is a branch — nothing else in the fixture reaches that member. Null viewer, null other: 0, never null. |
| feed_page, ranked output (regression) | The three fixture rows come back in the same order with the same `feed_score` to six decimal places as they did before the extraction: 54.328735 (mutual), 46.228735 (follow), 44.428735 (interaction only). Captured from the pre-refactor function, asserted against the post-refactor one. For qa: the fixture block at the top of 0038 is self-contained, so the same three numbers can be reproduced against any revision by pasting it into a psql transaction and calling `feed_page` — the literals are not a snapshot only this file can check. |
| feed_page vs relationship_score (drift) | **The "two copies cannot drift" pin**, the same pattern 0034 uses for `consistency_week_streaks()` versus `community_profile`: the gap between two feed rows that differ only in their author is asserted equal to 18 (`v_w_relationship`) times the gap between those two members' `relationship_score()`. Time-independent — the recency, engagement, personal and repetition terms are equal on both sides and cancel exactly — so it holds whenever the suite runs. `feed_page` cannot start scoring relationships differently from the function it calls without this failing. |
| feed_page, COMM-125 block edges | Unchanged and asserted here as well as in 0019: a block in either direction removes that author from the candidate set entirely, however high the relationship score would have been. The extraction must not loosen it, and the fixture deliberately blocks the highest-scoring author to check that the score does not buy a way past the filter. |
| people_suggestions (COMM-232), untouched | Asserted as a boundary rather than left as a comment: `people_suggestions`' body does not mention `relationship_score`, and `feed_page`'s does. Its shipped priority order — challenge, then interaction, then event — is pinned by 0034 and is a different question from "how close is this pair already". If a later ticket decides the two should share arithmetic, this fails and forces that to be a deliberate decision. |

### Classmate signal (202608310003, COMM-302)

No new table, so no new RLS policy: one new internal function and two
existing functions re-created around it.
`supabase/tests/0039_classmate_signal_test.sql` (37 assertions) runs every
boundary below on `migration-check`. There is no client half — `feed_page`
and `people_suggestions` keep their exact signatures, and
`people_suggestions`' returned shape only gains a key — so no `.test.mjs`
file moved and the node suite is unchanged at 791/790/1/0.

**The assertion pattern that matters most here is the toggle flip, not the
count.** For both `show_attendance` boundaries the test does not compare a
member who trained against a member who did not; it flips the toggle on an
*unchanged* set of `attendance_log` rows and watches the same data go from
nothing to a full signal and back. That is the difference between "no data"
and "private data", and it is the only form of the assertion that can catch a
gate being dropped.

One thing differs from COMM-302's own migration outline, which named only the
two `create or replace`s:

1. **A third function, `classmate_day_counts()`.** Both re-created functions
   need the same 60-day window, the same overlapping-`occurred_on` count and
   the same `show_attendance` gate, and the repo already knows what two copies
   cost — `community_profile`'s inline streak versus
   `consistency_week_streaks()` needs a standing pgTAP assertion to stop it
   drifting. The privacy gate in particular is the last thing that should
   exist twice: two copies means two chances to forget it. It is
   set-returning rather than scalar because `people_suggestions` builds its
   candidate set *from* its signals union, so a member whose only overlap is
   attendance has to be introduced by that branch or is never a candidate at
   all. It takes no viewer parameter on purpose — see the row below.

| Table / function / trigger | Boundary to assert |
|---|---|
| classmate_day_counts(), reachability | Revoked from `public`, `anon` **and** `authenticated`, `prosecdef` false — the same internal-plumbing shape `relationship_score()` (202608310002) and `consistency_week_streaks()` (202608290015) have. A real authenticated caller reaching for it gets 42501 from the grant, not from a check inside the body: **a member must not be able to ask who trains with whom, only to be ranked by it.** The `public` revoke is asserted separately, because a new function starts with `execute` granted to `PUBLIC`. |
| classmate_day_counts(), no viewer parameter | Deliberate, and the reason is worth checking in review rather than testing: `can_view_profile_field()` resolves *its* viewer from `auth.uid()` and cannot be told to answer for somebody else, so a `p_viewer` argument would be honoured by the overlap count and silently ignored by the privacy gate. That is the trap COMM-301 refused when it declined to hand `are_friends()` a viewer it would ignore. Both callers want the caller's own overlap anyway. |
| classmate_day_counts(), the count | One row per member with **at least one** shared day; a member with no overlap is absent, not a zero row, and both callers read absent as 0. Self is excluded, so a viewer's own posts pick up no class connection. Asserted at 4 days and 1 day against a fixture built directly in `attendance_log` (the trigger end is 0037's job, not this file's). |
| classmate_day_counts(), the 60-day window | A day both members trained **100 days ago** counts for nothing, with `show_attendance` **on** for that member, so nothing but the window can be doing the excluding. Both sides of the pair are filtered by it. The window is stated once, in this function, and is the same 60 days `people_suggestions`' two pre-existing time-stamped signals already use — so all four of that function's signals now share one period. |
| show_attendance, in both functions | **The boundary the whole ticket rests on.** `show_attendance` is attendance's own toggle (202608280003), separate from `visible_to_club`, and it **defaults to false** — so out of the box no member contributes a classmate signal to anyone. Asserted in three places, each by flipping the toggle on rows that do not change: the helper returns nothing then 4; `feed_page` scores that author 36.328735 then 39.328735, identically to a member with the same four days and the toggle on; `people_suggestions` drops a candidate whose only signal was attendance out of the strip entirely — not ranked lower, no card. Alongside each, an assertion that the member's `attendance_log` rows still exist, because those rows still count toward their own achievements (COMM-305) and their own leaderboard rank (COMM-306). For qa: the row count has to be read as the bootstrap superuser — `attendance_log`'s select policy is own-row for a member, so an authenticated count reads 0 for the wrong reason. |
| feed_page, the class component's normalisation | `least(1.0, shared_days / 8.0)` before `v_w_class = 6` — the engagement term's shape (a raw count over a saturation constant, capped), reaching the same 0..1 ceiling every other component does. Pinned three ways on three posts identical in every scored respect except their author's overlap: absolute scores to six decimal places (39.328735 / 37.078735 / 36.328735 on a `40 * 0.5^(5/36)` recency base), and the **gaps** between them, which are time-independent because every other term cancels — 4 of the 8 saturating days is exactly 3.000000 and 1 day is exactly 0.750000. The fixture block is self-contained and reproducible in a psql transaction, like 0038's. |
| feed_page, the cap | 8 shared days and 12 shared days both score exactly 6.000000 above the recency term. Saturating rather than scaling by the window length is deliberate: dividing by 60 would make even a daily training partner worth a rounding error. This is the boundary a "capped at 1 before its weight applies" rule actually means, and the one most easily lost. |
| feed_page, zero overlap | A viewer who has never logged a session still gets **every** row, all scoring the same, because the class component is 0 for all of them. Zero shared days is a zero — never a missing term, never an omitted row, never a raise. |
| feed_page, my_classes still parked | Unchanged and deliberate: COMM-302 wired the class-connection **score**, not the my-classes **scope**. `attendance_log` records days, not classes, so it carries no class identity to filter a post by. The scope still returns empty and the client still renders that chip disabled. Flagged for qa as a thing that looks like an omission and is not. |
| people_suggestions, the new priority order | **challenge, classmate, interaction, event**, asserted as an order across four candidates each carrying a different strongest signal, not as four separate labels. Still lexicographic, not a weighted sum: the fixture's challenge candidate has **one** shared training day and the classmate candidate has **four**, and the challenge candidate still comes first, so no amount of a weaker signal overtakes a stronger one. Position 2 is a product decision COMM-302 states rather than derives. |
| people_suggestions, additive shape | `signals` gains `shared_classmate_days` carrying the real day count (asserted at 4, not as a boolean); `shared_challenges`, `shared_interactions` and `shared_events` keep their names and their meanings — asserted as a whole-object `jsonb` equality, so a rename or a removal fails rather than slipping past a key-by-key check. `reason` gains `'classmate'`. This is exactly the shape 202608290015's own comment promised, and it is why no client changed. |
| Block edges, COMM-125, in both functions | A block in **either** direction, on the pair with the highest overlap in the fixture, so nothing can pass on the strength of its signal: the candidate leaves `people_suggestions`, their post leaves `feed_page` entirely (a block is strictly stronger than the class component, not merely heavier than it), and the helper itself refuses the pair. Not re-implemented anywhere — `can_view_profile_field()` settles a block before it consults any toggle, which is what `people_suggestions` already relied on for its other three signals. |
| The two surfaces cannot drift | The same pin 0034 uses for `consistency_week_streaks()` versus `community_profile` and 0038 uses for `feed_page` versus `relationship_score()`: both function bodies are asserted to mention `classmate_day_counts`, and the `shared_classmate_days` the strip publishes is asserted equal to the number the helper returned. One copy of the window, the overlap count and the privacy gate. |

### Consistency on verified attendance (202608310004, COMM-306)

No new table, so no new RLS policy: three existing functions re-created and
not one new one. `supabase/tests/0040_consistency_on_attendance_test.sql` (31
assertions) runs every boundary below on `migration-check`, and
`supabase/tests/0034_feed_leaderboard_and_suggestions_test.sql` keeps all 53
of its own, re-run against the new source. There is no client half — both
signatures and both returned shapes are unchanged, so no `.test.mjs` file
moved and the node suite is unchanged at 791/790/1/0.

**The 0034 fixture changed and no 0034 assertion did.** That file's streaks
are now `attendance_log` days instead of POST_WORKOUT / POST_PR rows; every
ranking, tie-break, toggle, scope and self-row assertion in it is the one
202608290015 shipped with. Two mechanical consequences worth knowing before
reading the diff: its consistency fixture opts every member into
`show_attendance` (the column defaults false, so a board of members who have
not opted in is a board of one), and its `people_suggestions` section deletes
the attendance rows before building its own fixtures, because since COMM-302 a
shared training day is that function's second-strongest signal and would
otherwise re-rank a section that is not about it.

One thing differs from COMM-306's own migration outline, which named the
`show_attendance` gate only for the leaderboard:

1. **`community_profile`'s `current_streak` key is gated on
   `show_attendance` as well as `show_workout_results`.** The number is
   attendance-derived now, and 202608310001 wrote the rule down: the table's
   staff policy is deliberately not gated on that toggle, and every
   member-facing Phase 3 reader applies it in its own body. Without it the
   function would publish an attendance-derived figure past attendance's own
   toggle, by default, for every member — and would contradict
   `feed_leaderboard`, which excludes that same member from the board.
   Expressed as an absent key, which has meant "hidden" in this function since
   COMM-180 and which the client already renders as no row. Both toggles
   default false, so the pairing only ever narrows. Reverting it is deleting
   one `if`.

| Table / function / trigger | Boundary to assert |
|---|---|
| consistency_week_streaks(), the source | Distinct ISO weeks carrying an `attendance_log.occurred_on` day, anchored on the member's most recent such week, counted back while each week is exactly 7 days before the previous, anchor must be the current week or the previous one. Same arithmetic as 202608290015, one table swapped — asserted behaviourally in **both directions**, which is the assertion that actually proves the swap: a member with three weeks of posted workouts and **no** attendance reads 0, and a member with attendance and **no post of any kind** reads their real streak. Under the old body those two numbers were the other way round, so a fixture built only on attendance could not have caught a revert. Backed by a static pin as well: the body mentions `attendance_log` and no longer mentions `workout_posts` at all. |
| consistency_week_streaks(), reachability | Unchanged and re-asserted, because a `create or replace` starts the grant story over: revoked from `public`, `anon` **and** `authenticated`, `prosecdef` still false. It reads every member's days only by borrowing `feed_leaderboard`'s definer rights past `attendance_log_self_select`. The `public` revoke is asserted separately, as in 0038 and 0039. |
| consistency_week_streaks(), no privacy filter | **Deliberate, and the one place this ticket departs from `classmate_day_counts()`'s shape** (202608310003, which folds `show_attendance` into itself). That helper's callers both want an opted-out member to read as absent; this one's caller must *exclude* them from a ranked set, and a gate inside the helper would produce exactly the coalesced 0 the ticket rules out. So the gate lives in `feed_leaderboard`, where "excluded" can be expressed, and the helper stays pure arithmetic over a table nobody can reach. Worth a reviewer's eye rather than a test: it is a reasoned inconsistency with a sibling function, not an oversight. |
| feed_leaderboard, show_attendance | **The boundary the privacy half of the ticket rests on.** A member with `show_attendance` off is **absent from the consistency board, not ranked at 0** — asserted as both an `is_empty` on their row and a count that goes 6 → 7, on a fixture member holding exactly the same two training weeks as an opted-in member, with the toggle flipped on rows that do not change. That flip is the whole proof: a member zeroed and a member excluded are different claims about them, and on a board where 0 is a real value, ranking an opted-out member at 0 would state something false rather than withhold something true. Alongside it, an assertion that their `attendance_log` rows still exist — read as the bootstrap superuser, since that table's select policy is own-row for a member. |
| feed_leaderboard, self is still always included | The caller gets their own row at their real streak **with their own `show_attendance` off**, and their board is the opted-in members plus themselves. `can_view_profile_field()` answers true for `p_target = auth.uid()` before it reads any toggle, so the new predicate is self-exempt exactly as `in_leaderboards` and `visible_to_club` already are. Opting out removes you from other members' boards, never from your own — the same rule 0034 already pins for `in_leaderboards`. |
| feed_leaderboard, progress mode untouched | The predicate sits inside the consistency branch of `valued`, not in `cand`, so a challenge ranking is not narrowed by a toggle that has no bearing on it. Asserted directly: the member excluded from the consistency board for `show_attendance` **leads** the progress board. |
| feed_leaderboard, zero is real | A member with no `attendance_log` row at all is ranked at 0 rather than dropped — there is no real rank to report from a set the caller was filtered out of, which is why the zeros have to be in it. The same rule on the profile side: `community_profile` returns `current_streak` 0 for such a member and does not raise. This is `feed_leaderboard`'s own pre-existing rule, unchanged, and the reason the exclusion above had to be an exclusion. |
| community_profile, current_streak | Moved onto the same source in the same migration, which is the only reason 0034's standing "the two copies agree" assertion could be re-run rather than retired. Asserted on both fixture directions like the helper (posting member 0, training member 1) and gated on `show_attendance` — the key is **absent**, not zeroed, when the toggle is off, and back at its real value when it is flipped on with no row changed. |
| community_profile, training_frequency and recent_workouts | **The boundary COMM-306 draws by exclusion**, asserted rather than left as a comment: both still read `workout_posts`, both are still under `show_workout_results` alone, and both are **still present on a profile whose `current_streak` the attendance toggle has just removed**. Plus the two halves shown apart: a member whose only activity is posts has `training_frequency` and a 0 streak; a member who trains and never posts has a real streak and no `training_frequency` at all. The two numbers answer different questions and did not merge. A static pin backs it — `community_profile`'s body mentions both tables. |
| The two copies still cannot drift | 0034's original pin (the caller's own board value equals their `community_profile` `current_streak`) is re-run against the new source and kept. 0040 widens it to the whole board at once: an `is_empty` over every ranked member whose value disagrees with the streak their own profile publishes, with an `isnt_empty` beside it so an all-zero fixture cannot pass it vacuously — the shape 0038 established. Readable set-wide only because every fixture member has both profile toggles on. |

### Trained-with-you today (202608310005, COMM-307)

No new table, so no new RLS policy: one new function and not one existing
function re-created. `supabase/tests/0041_attendance_classmates_today_test.sql`
(35 assertions) runs every boundary below on `migration-check`. Unlike
COMM-301, COMM-302 and COMM-306, this ticket does need a client half, and it
now has one: the card, the follow action and the `classmates_card_viewed`
event landed in the same ticket, covered by
`test/community-classmates-today.test.mjs` (11 tests, node suite
791/790/1/0 → 802/801/1/0). The boundaries below are still the schema half's;
the client half's own are the last row of the table.

**Two things the ticket left to this half to decide**, both settled here and
both worth a reviewer's attention rather than a skim:

1. **The caller's own `show_attendance` is enforced inside the function.**
   COMM-307 states the behaviour ("off means the card never renders for them,
   even though their own attendance is still logged and still counts
   elsewhere") without saying where the gate lives, and the client could have
   skipped the call instead. It does not, for three reasons: every boundary in
   this module is enforced server-side rather than by a UI check, and the
   vendored Supabase client makes every RPC callable from a console; it is a
   *reciprocity* rule, and every member on the card has opted into being seen
   training, so a member who declined that must not read the list; and
   202608310001's standing rule already says every member-facing Phase 3
   reader applies this toggle in its own body, which COMM-302 and COMM-306
   both did. It is a **direct `profiles` column read**, not
   `can_view_profile_field(auth.uid(), ...)` — that helper answers true for
   the caller before it reads any toggle, so it could not express the
   question at all. Off yields an **empty set, never a raise**.
2. **`p_limit int default 6`, clamped 1..20.** The forward reference in
   `contracts.md` named a zero-argument function; the parameter is defaulted,
   so that call form still resolves verbatim (the same accommodation COMM-301
   made with `p_as_of`). 6 is card-sized for COMM-115's feed-top slot where
   `people_suggestions`' 10 is a scrolling strip. **The clamp range is the
   server's and is now fixed; the default inside it is the client half's to
   revisit by passing an argument.**

| Table / function / trigger | Boundary to assert |
|---|---|
| attendance_classmates_today(), reachability | The opposite grant story from `classmate_day_counts()`: this one **is** a client entry point. `prosecdef` true, `execute` granted to `authenticated`, revoked from `anon` **and** from `public` (asserted separately, since a new function starts with `execute` granted to `PUBLIC`). Definer for exactly one boundary, the one `people_suggestions` already documents — `attendance_log` is own-row plus staff, so without elevation the function could only ever return the caller's own row, which is the one row it excludes. A null `auth.uid()` **raises** `not authorized` rather than returning empty, checked before anything is read: it is an entry point, not a helper. |
| Today only, both sides | **The boundary that separates this ticket from COMM-302.** `occurred_on = current_date` on both sides of the self-join, no window, no lookback, no count. Asserted in three directions: a pair who both logged today appear for each other; a member who logged **yesterday** with `show_attendance` **on** is absent, so nothing but the day can be excluding them (`classmate_day_counts()` would have counted that pair); and a caller who did not log today gets nothing at all, however many members did — the anchor is the caller's own row and the join enforces that on its own rather than by a separate check. Backed by a static pin: the body reads `current_date` and mentions neither `classmate_day_counts` nor `interval`/`make_interval` anywhere, so "no window arithmetic" is mechanical rather than a comment. |
| The returned shape | Exactly four keys — `user_id`, `display_name`, `handle`, `avatar_url` — asserted as a **whole-object `jsonb` equality**, so an added key fails here rather than slipping past a key-by-key check. No date, no time, no count, no streak, no session detail may leave this function: a caller learns that these members trained today and nothing about any other day. Those four are also exactly the header `community_profile` already returns to any member for any member, so nothing newly reachable is published. |
| show_attendance on a candidate | The same toggle-flip proof style 0039 and 0040 use, and for the same reason: the test does not compare a member who trained against one who did not, it flips the toggle on an **unchanged** `attendance_log` row and watches the same data go from absent to listed and back. Alongside it, an assertion that the row still exists — read as the bootstrap superuser, since `attendance_log`'s select policy is own-row for a member and an authenticated count would read 0 for the wrong reason. The toggle **defaults to false**, so out of the box this card is empty for everybody. |
| **show_attendance on the CALLER** | **The ticket's own product decision, so it is asserted explicitly rather than inferred.** A caller with it off gets an **empty set — the whole card, not a shorter one** — while two opted-in members who trained today were on it a moment before, and their own attendance row for today still exists (checked as the superuser). Empty rather than an error, asserted with a `lives_ok` beside the `is_empty`: the three ways to get no card — did not train, trained alone, opted out — are indistinguishable from outside, so nothing about the caller's setting leaks into the response shape and the client needs no new branch. Flipping their own toggle back on returns the same two members on the same unchanged rows. |
| The admin short-circuit, on one side only | The consequence of the caller-side gate being a direct column read, asserted rather than left as a comment, and the one section in the file deliberately called **as the admin**: an admin who never opted into `show_attendance` gets an **empty card like anybody else**, because the direct read does not carry `can_view_profile_field`'s `is_admin()` short-circuit. Once opted in, that same admin sees every member who trained today **including the ones who opted out** — the short-circuit does apply to the per-candidate gate, the module-wide behaviour of the one resolution point that `feed_leaderboard`'s contract already records. Asserted both as a count and by naming the opted-out member specifically, so the count cannot pass for the wrong reason. |
| Block edges, COMM-125 | A block in **either** direction removes the pair, with an `isnt_empty` beside each `is_empty` confirming the other candidate is still on the card, so it is the edge doing it and not a broken fixture. Not re-implemented anywhere in the function — `can_view_profile_field` settles a block before it consults any toggle, and it carries deleted profiles and `visible_to_club` in the same call, which is why there is no second predicate for either. |
| Self exclusion | The caller never appears in their own results. A member is not their own classmate — the same self-exclusion `classmate_day_counts()` and `relationship_score()` both keep. |
| p_limit, the clamp | Asserted against a pool of **27 eligible candidates** (25 extra opted-in members inserted for this section alone), so the upper clamp is a real cut and not "all of them": default 6, `3` → 3, `null` → 6, `0` → 1, `-5` → 1, `50` → 20. Zero clamping **up** to 1 rather than returning an empty card is deliberate — an empty card would look exactly like a member who trained alone. For qa: the clamp range is fixed server-side now, so the client half can lower the default it passes but cannot widen the range. |
| The order | Most recently recorded first (`attendance_log.recorded_at`), then display name falling back to handle, then id. Asserted across two fixture groups with different `recorded_at` values, so both the recency ordering **and** the alphabetical tie-break inside a tied group are exercised — a fixture that let `recorded_at` default would tie every row, since `now()` is frozen for the transaction, and the documented order would never run. Every member in the set trained today so there is no signal to rank by and the order is a choice: an alphabetical cut would show the same few members every single day in a club bigger than `p_limit`. `recorded_at` is when the row was written, not when the member trained — `attendance_log` records a day, not a time — which is why it is only the first key of a total order and not a claim the card makes. |
| COMM-307's client half | Now built, in `test/community-classmates-today.test.mjs` (11 tests) rather than pgTAP. What qa should re-check by hand rather than trust the test names for: **the omission**, which has four separate paths to the same nothing (empty set, caller did not train today, caller's own `show_attendance` off, failed fetch) and no heading, empty state, retry or skeleton in any of them — a regression here shows up as a stray grey box on the Feed sub-tab for members who never opted in, since `show_attendance` defaults false and the empty card is the common case, not the edge one. **The Follow control**, which is rendered on every row and deliberately does *not* copy the `allow_follows === false ? "" : button` guard the directory and following lists use, because the RPC has no such key and copying it would compare `undefined` to `false` and read as if it were doing something; `follows_insert_self` is the real gate. **No Message affordance**, asserted on the card and on the whole surface. **`classmates_card_viewed`**, once per load and not per re-render, absent entirely when there is no card, carrying a row count and a source and no member identity, and **not** in `ACTIVE_MEMBER_EVENTS`. Also worth a look: the client passes `p_limit: 6` explicitly rather than defaulting, so the card-sized number lives at the card; and there is no client-side date arithmetic anywhere, so "today" is only ever the server's. |

### Personalized feed ranking (202608310006, COMM-303)

One new table, two new functions, and `feed_page` re-created a third time.
`supabase/tests/0042_personalized_feed_weights_test.sql` (61 assertions) runs
every boundary below on `migration-check`, taking the suite 1123 → **1184**.
There is no client half — the ticket says so ("No new UI — personalization is
invisible ranking, not a setting") — so no `.test.mjs` file moved and the node
suite is unchanged at 802/801/1/0.

**READ THIS FIRST: the derivation is not built, and the ticket does not ask
for it.** Nothing writes `member_feed_weights`.
`recompute_feed_weights(p_limit)` is a real service-role-only function with an
empty body that always returns 0, asserted as a no-op in 0042 so it cannot
quietly start writing. Every member therefore has no row and gets the fixed
defaults. What shipped is the **storage** and the **reader**; the "storage
exists, computation does not" shape 202608280028 and 202608290011 already
carry. It is stubbed rather than omitted so `feed_page` is not left reading a
table with no named writer, and empty rather than heuristic because a guessed
derivation ships unreviewed ranking to every member and nobody can see that
their own feed is subtly wrong.

**The load-bearing assertion in this file is the one that proves nothing
happened.** Section D ranks the same fixture posts 0038 used and asserts the
same three `feed_score` literals to six decimal places — numbers captured from
`feed_page` as it stood *before* COMM-301, so they have now survived three
re-creations of that function unchanged. It asserts it five times over: no
stored row, an empty object, an explicit all-1.0 object, every multiplier at
the 2.5 ceiling, and a row of junk. A fourth fixture post scoring on recency
alone was added beyond 0038's three, so one row in the file reads a single
weight directly.

**Three things a reviewer should look at rather than skim:**

1. **The sum invariant is a bounded proportional rescale, not a clamp.** A
   naive per-component clamp-and-use does not sum to anything fixed, which
   would make a boost an inflation; a naive clamp-then-rescale restores the
   sum and pushes components back out of the bounds they were just clamped
   into (worked counterexample on this module's real numbers, in the migration
   header and asserted in 0042: `{recency 2.5, rest 0.4}` scales the seven
   un-boosted components to 0.344× their default, under the floor). The
   water-filling loop pins at a bound and redistributes the remaining budget
   over what is still free, so both invariants hold *by construction* — and
   the result is then summed and bounds-checked anyway before it is used, with
   any violation returning the defaults unchanged.
2. **"The positive weights sum to 104" was stale by 6.** It was correct in
   202608280019, when `v_w_class` was declared at 6 and multiplied by a hard 0
   — seven live weights, 104. COMM-302 turned that component on and left the
   comment. The eight declared weights have summed to **110** since
   202608310003. COMM-303 corrects the comment and **moves no weight**:
   renormalising down to 104 would change every existing feed score on deploy
   day, which is exactly what this ticket must not do. The invariant enforced
   is "a personalized set sums to whatever the default block sums to",
   computed at call time and nowhere hardcoded.
3. **The two numbers COMM-303's open question flagged are now fixed
   server-side.** Clamp bounds 0.40..2.50 of each component's default (the
   ticket's own worked example, adopted as the real value) and a **weekly**
   recomputation cadence. Both are tunable rather than architectural; the
   cadence is expressed in exactly one place, the commented cron line in the
   migration, and nothing in the schema depends on it.

| Table / function / trigger | Boundary to assert |
|---|---|
| member_feed_weights (table) | Three columns: `user_id uuid pk references profiles(id) on delete cascade` (asserted as `confdeltype = 'c'`, so a purged member leaves no orphan), `weights jsonb not null default '{}'`, `computed_at timestamptz not null default now()`. **No `club_id`**, unlike `weekly_recaps` — the row is a private ranking artifact about one member, nothing aggregates it per club, and so this table also needs no `default_club_id()` grant, which is the one thing 202608290011 had to add for its own service-role writer. One addition beyond the ticket's outline: a check constraint `jsonb_typeof(weights) = 'object'`, asserted against both `[1,2,3]` and a bare string. The reader defends against a non-object anyway; a column every reader treats as an object should still not be able to hold one. |
| member_feed_weights, no client write | `authenticated` has `select` and nothing else; `anon` has nothing and gets 42501 rather than an empty result. There is **no insert, update or delete policy for any role** — counted from `pg_policies` with `cmd <> 'SELECT'`, so a later addition fails here rather than slipping in — and a plain member gets 42501 on all three against their **own** row, as does an admin. This is the boundary the whole ticket rests on: a member who could write here would be supplying their own ranking input, which is precisely what COMM-303's contract section refuses when it says the weights are "never passed as a parameter". The `select` grant is deliberate: there is nothing private in a member's own weights and a "why is my feed like this" conversation is easier when they are inspectable. |
| member_feed_weights, the write path | Exercised as a **real `service_role`**, not the bootstrap superuser, which would sail past a missing grant: the insert succeeds and `computed_at` defaults on its own, so a writer that only knows the multipliers still produces a complete row. |
| The stored shape | Multipliers relative to `feed_page`'s defaults, not absolute weights — 1.0 is the default, an absent key is 1.0, unknown keys are ignored by the reader rather than rejected (asserted: `"loudness"` never reaches `feed_page`). Multipliers because the default block has already been retuned twice in this module's life, and absolute weights would silently become wrong the next time a default moves. **`'{}'` is the thin-signal answer and is deliberately indistinguishable from no row at all**, so a job can record "looked on Monday, found nothing" with a fresh `computed_at` without that meaning anything different for the feed — which is COMM-303's "never produces a personalized weight set from zero data" made structural rather than conditional. |
| **feed_page with no stored weights — THE CRITICAL ONE** | Byte-identical ranking and `feed_score` to six decimal places against literals captured from the pre-COMM-301 function, five times over (no row, `'{}'`, all-1.0, all-2.5, junk). The all-2.5 case is worth its own look: **a uniform boost is not a boost** — it cancels in the rescale — which is what "redistributes rather than inflates" means at its limit. The junk case (`"banana"`, a json `null`, an unknown key, a nested object) raises nothing: a malformed row costs a member their personalization, never their feed. |
| feed_weights_resolve(), reachability | Revoked from `public`, `anon` **and** `authenticated`; `prosecdef` false. Internal plumbing, the shape `relationship_score()` and `classmate_day_counts()` established. A real authenticated caller gets 42501 from the grant, not from a check inside the body. The `public` revoke is asserted separately, because a new function starts with `execute` granted to `PUBLIC`. Note it **does** take a user parameter, unlike `classmate_day_counts()` — not the same trap, because it consults no privacy toggle that would silently ignore the argument. |
| feed_weights_resolve(), the sum | Over **seven pathological stored rows**, the resolved set sums to exactly what the default block sums to, and a companion assertion pins that total at 110 today. Plus an anti-vacuity assertion that none of the seven resolved back to the defaults, so neither the sum nor the bounds check passed for the wrong reason. |
| feed_weights_resolve(), the bounds | No component of any of the seven leaves `0.40..2.50` of its **own** default. The `{recency 2.5, rest 0.4}` case is additionally read off value by value — the seven un-boosted components sit exactly **on** the floor (`18*0.4 = 7.2`, `6*0.4 = 2.4`) and recency absorbs the whole remaining budget at 82, which is 2.05× its default and inside the ceiling. That is the case a naive rescale gets wrong, so it is asserted individually rather than only in aggregate. |
| The defaults live in one place | `feed_weights_resolve` takes the defaults as a **parameter** rather than holding a copy, so the eight numbers stay stated once, in `feed_page`'s weight block — the function owns the algorithm, `feed_page` owns the numbers, and there is no pair to drift. 0042 holds a second copy for its own arithmetic and pins it to `feed_page`'s `prosrc` line by line, so retuning a weight fails this file rather than silently testing stale numbers. It is also component-agnostic: it never names `recency` or `class`, so a ninth weight needs no edit there. |
| recompute_feed_weights(), reachability and no-op | `execute` granted to `service_role` only, revoked from `public`, `anon` and `authenticated`; `prosecdef` true, with **no `auth.uid()` check** — the same documented exception `notif_batch_flush_due()`, `notif_queue_batched()`, `seed_onboarding_progress()` and `post_new_member_on_join()` already carry, since `service_role` has no uid and the grant is what stands in for one. Both call forms return **0**, and the table is still empty afterwards — asserted, so a later edit that starts writing rows has to break this line deliberately. `p_limit` is accepted and unused today on purpose, so a scheduler's call site does not change when the body lands. **For qa: nothing schedules it.** The resolved cadence is weekly and lives only in a commented `pg_cron` line. |
| A stored row really moves the score | `{"relationship": 2.5}` widens the gap between two rows differing only in their author to exactly the **resolved** weight times the `relationship_score` gap — closed-form, `18 * 2.5 * 110/137`, independent of when the suite runs, because the recency, engagement, personal and repetition terms are equal on both sides and cancel. Stated as a direction too (`> 8.1`, the default gap), so the exact-value assertion cannot pass with the sign inverted. And the row with no signal but freshness scores **lower**, at exactly its old score times the `110/137` rescale: the budget relationship gained came out of the other seven components. Note that rows which *do* carry relationship go **up** in absolute terms — "everything goes down" would have been the wrong claim. |
| **v_w_class moves like any other weight** | COMM-303 names it explicitly, so it is asserted explicitly rather than assumed to fall out of "all eight". Two fresh members with no follow edge either way, one post each at the same instant, eight shared training days (exactly `v_class_saturation`, so the component is at its 1.0 ceiling): on the defaults the classmate author leads by exactly 6, COMM-302's number unchanged; with `{"class": 2.5}` the gap becomes the resolved `6 * 2.5 * 110/119 = 13.865546`. Alongside it, the block edge is still strictly stronger than any weight personalization can give the component — a blocked author never reaches the scoring pass, however far the member has boosted the thing that would have favoured them. |
| COMM-112 diversity, after scoring and unchanged | Asserted **structurally** — read off `prosrc`, the weight resolution appears before the scoring query and the diversity pass still after it, and the four diversity limits are still `constant` at 2/2/3/2 — and **behaviourally**: on a feed scored with a personalized weight set at the ceiling, `v_max_same_author` still breaks a run at two and displaces the third post by that author with a lower-scoring one from someone else. Personalization changes emphasis inside the ranked set, never the diversity guarantee across it. |
| Where the lookup sits in feed_page | After the `auth.uid()` check and after the parked `my_classes` scope has already returned, before anything is scored: **one lookup per feed request**, never one per candidate row, and fixed for the whole call the way `v_anchor` is — so page 2 of a session scores on the same weights as page 1, the same property COMM-301's `p_as_of` exists to protect. `feed_page` is definer so this reads past `member_feed_weights_self_select`, but only ever for `v_uid`, which is the one row that policy would have granted the caller anyway. |

### Attendance achievements and milestone posts (202608310007, COMM-305)

No new table, so no new RLS policy. One `UPDATE` to four seeded rows, two new
functions, one trigger on `attendance_log`, one partial expression index on
`workout_posts`. `supabase/tests/0043_attendance_achievements_test.sql` (50
assertions) runs every boundary below on `migration-check`, taking the suite
1184 → **1234**. There is no client half — the ticket says so ("No new client
work: `renderPostCard`'s `POST_ATTENDANCE_MILESTONE` branch ... already exist
and render real data unchanged") — so no `.test.mjs` file moved and the node
suite is unchanged at 802/801/1/0.

**Two existing pgTAP assertions were rewritten rather than left to fail**, in
`0007` and `0020`: both said "the four attendance rows are disabled", which is
the state this ticket exists to change. Neither migration was touched, and the
static assertion that 202608280007 *seeds* them disabled still runs unchanged
in `test/community-rls-boundaries.test.mjs`, which reads that migration's text
directly. `0020`'s rewrite makes its neighbouring assertion **stronger**: an
attendance code used to be refused by `ach_claim` twice over (disabled *and*
`ATTENDANCE_RECORDED`) and could have been passing on the wrong one of the
two; only `trigger_type` and the absent `client_claimable` key are left.

**Three things a reviewer should look at rather than skim:**

1. **The count milestones test state; the repeatable streak tests an event.**
   That asymmetry is deliberate. "Have they got this badge already" is a
   state, answerable from the table plus `member_achievements_once_idx`, and a
   just-crossed delta (`count - 1 < threshold`) breaks on any multi-row insert
   because Postgres queues AFTER-FOR-EACH-ROW triggers to the end of the
   statement — all 30 rows of a 30-row insert see a count of 30, and nothing
   is ever the 25th. "Did a fresh streak just start qualifying" cannot be
   answered from state at all, because the member is *meant* to earn it again,
   so it is computed as a genuine before/after crossing. The cost of that,
   stated rather than buried: a multi-row insert awards no streak badge.
2. **The `show_attendance` gate is a write-time gate**, which is the one place
   this toggle behaves differently from every other use of it in the module.
   It is read once, off the member's own `profiles` row, at the moment of the
   unlock, and never re-asked. Turning it on later does not retro-publish a
   milestone crossed while it was off. That is asserted directly, and it is
   also why the proof of the gate needed a shape 0039 and 0040 did not: the
   same member across a flip, plus a second member holding the identical days
   with the opposite setting.
3. **The four assertions that matter were mutation-tested before this file was
   handed over.** Replacing the fresh-crossing test with `streak >= threshold`
   fails five assertions; removing the `show_attendance` gate fails three;
   forcing the already-posted guard false fails one; dropping `threshold > 1`
   so a first class posts fails four. None of the boundaries below passes
   vacuously.

| Table / function / trigger | Boundary to assert |
|---|---|
| achievement_definitions, the four attendance rows | All four `trigger_type = 'ATTENDANCE_RECORDED'` rows are `enabled`, exactly one of them (`attendance_weekly_streak`) is `repeatable`. The `UPDATE` is keyed on `trigger_type`, not on a list of four codes, so a fifth attendance definition is enabled by its own seed row. Thresholds are unchanged (1/25/100/4) and are now load-bearing: the trigger reads every one of them from this table and keeps no second copy, asserted by comparing the post's `count` against `d.threshold` and its `milestone_label` against `d.name` rather than against literals. |
| ach_claim, still refuses all four | Asserted now that only one reason is left. Called as a member who **holds the repeatable code** — if `ach_claim` accepted it the call would write a second row rather than being absorbed by the once-per-code index, which is the strongest form available — and separately as a member who has genuinely reached a milestone, since qualifying is not the question. Both return nothing and write nothing. `ach_claim`'s `<> 'ATTENDANCE_RECORDED'` line is also pinned textually, so a later edit to that function fails here. Attendance is the one category in this schema that is purely server-derived and never client-trusted. |
| attendance_log_milestones (AFTER INSERT on attendance_log) | The trigger exists, is not internal, carries no `WHEN` clause. Its function is `prosecdef`, revoked from `public`, `anon` **and** `authenticated` — reachable as a trigger and nowhere else. No `auth.uid()` check, the same documented exception `attendance_log_from_record()`, `post_new_member_on_join()` and `notif_queue_batched()` carry. It is definer for exactly two boundaries: `member_achievements` has no client insert grant or policy, and an authorless `workout_posts` row is unreachable through `posts_insert_self`. |
| Crossing 1 / 25 / 100, exactly once | One logged day unlocks `attendance_first_class`; twenty-four days do not mint the 25 badge early; the twenty-fifth does; **five further days past the threshold add no second badge and no second post**, which is the only form of the assertion that separates "fires on the crossing" from "fires whenever it qualifies". Same again at 99 → 100. `member_achievements_once_idx` is what actually holds it under concurrency (`insert ... on conflict do nothing returning id`), so a lost race is swallowed, never surfaced. |
| A first class is an achievement and not also a post | Asserted per member (the coach, one day, `show_attendance` **on**, so nothing but the rule can be suppressing it) *and* set-wide (no `POST_ATTENDANCE_MILESTONE` anywhere carries `count = 1`), with an anti-vacuity assertion beside it that milestone posts do exist. The rule is `threshold > 1`, not a two-code allow list, so a future `attendance_250_classes` posts automatically and a future first-anything does not. Matches how every other unlock is celebrated: `ach_claim` writes a row for a first PR and never a post. |
| POST_ATTENDANCE_MILESTONE, the shape | Read off the row, not the migration text: `author_id` null, `visibility = 'club'`, `status = 'active'`, `source_type = 'member'`, `source_id` the member, `metadata` carrying `milestone_label` and `count` (the two keys `renderAttendanceMilestonePostCard` has read since Phase 1) plus `member_id`. `club` is verified as a real target by having **another member** read the row through `post_visible_to_viewer()`, not by trusting the column value. Same authorless shape `post_new_member_on_join` and `challenge_progress_apply`'s cooperative milestone already write. |
| show_attendance suppresses the post, never the achievement | Two-sided. A member with the toggle **off** holding exactly the days a member with it **on** holds earns both achievements and gets no post, while the other gets one — so it is the privacy choice doing it, not the data. Their twenty-five attendance rows all still exist. Then the flip, on rows that do not change: turning it on publishes **nothing retroactively**, and the member's next genuine crossing (the 100th) does post. Achievements have their own toggle (`show_achievements`) and this is not it. `show_attendance` **defaults to false**, so out of the box the trigger unlocks achievements for everyone and posts for nobody. |
| Never double-posted, and the guard is workout_posts itself | A `POST_ATTENDANCE_MILESTONE` row is **planted for a member before they have trained a single day**; their real crossing then unlocks the achievement and adds no second post, and the surviving post is verifiably the planted one. That only passes if "already posted this milestone" is read from `workout_posts` by `(member_id, count)` — the way `challenge_progress_apply` asks the same question — rather than from a second piece of tracking state. Deliberately a guard and not a unique index, the reason 202608290014 spells out: a unique violation would abort a member's training-log sync over a duplicate feed post. Backed by `workout_posts_attendance_milestone_metadata_idx`. |
| attendance_weekly_streak, a FRESH crossing | Week by week, one statement per week, which is what the production writer produces. Three weeks: no badge. The fourth: one badge. **A second day inside a week that already counted: nothing** (excluding that day leaves the week standing, so before = after). **A fifth week: nothing** — this is the case a bare `streak >= 4` would get wrong, re-minting the badge every training day for the rest of the run. Then the break and rebuild: the fourth week of the *second* run fires it **again**, count 2, while the member's non-repeatable first-class badge stayed at 1 across both runs. |
| The crossing is two-sided, not an equality | A member with four stale weeks behind a gap trains three fresh weeks (streak 3, no badge) and then the single week that joins the two runs: the streak goes **3 → 8 in one insert** and fires exactly once. A `streak = 4` equality test would miss it entirely. The same fixture also pins the anchor rule: four consecutive weeks that ended a month ago are worth a streak of 0 and no badge, because a streak has to be live — the same number the member's profile and the consistency board show them. |
| attendance_week_streak(uuid, date) | New, internal, `security invoker`, revoked from `public`, `anon` and `authenticated`. It exists because the repeatable code has to know what the streak was *before* the row that just landed, which `consistency_week_streaks()` is set-wide and zero-argument and cannot answer. **Pinned against it for every member of the fixture at once** (with an anti-vacuity assertion that the set is not all zeros), the same drift-pin shape 0040 uses for `community_profile`'s inline copy — so a future edit to one that is not made to the other fails CI rather than quietly splitting the definition of a streak in two. |
| ACHIEVEMENT_UNLOCKED, no new code | Asserted rather than assumed, because the claim being made is "nothing was needed": `member_achievements_notify` (202608280027) is AFTER INSERT on `member_achievements` with `tgqual is null` — no `WHEN` clause, no filter on how the row got there — and a real `achievement_unlocked` notification row is found joined back to the attendance-sourced `member_achievements` row. An attendance unlock notifies exactly like a claimed one. |
| ach_evaluate is still not built | Asserted as an absence: no `public.ach_evaluate` exists. COMM-305 follows the direct table-trigger precedent `challenge_progress_apply` set and explicitly does not build the generic event-bus consumer. Attendance is now the only trigger type with a real server-side producer; everything community-, challenge- and club-shaped in the seed still cannot be earned at all. |
| No backfill, and what happens instead | The migration awards nothing at migration time — 202608310001's `attendance_log` backfill is finished before this trigger exists, which that migration said in as many words was the reason to backfill there rather than later. **For qa:** because the count branch reads state, a member whose backfilled history already stands at 60 days earns `attendance_first_class` and `attendance_25_classes` on their *next* logged session, once each, spread across the club as members sync rather than as a deploy-day burst. The feed side of that is bounded by `show_attendance` defaulting to false. |

### Member of the week (202609010001, COMM-315)

One new table, four new functions, one widened `CHECK` on
`admin_actions.action_type`, no existing policy touched and no existing
function re-created. `supabase/tests/0045_member_of_week_test.sql` (76
assertions) runs every boundary below on `migration-check`, taking the suite
1292 → **1368**. There is no client half yet — the suggestion card, the
publish control and the coach's-pick form land separately — so no `.test.mjs`
file moved.

**Four things a reviewer should look at rather than skim:**

1. **The rotation index is weeks-since-a-fixed-Monday mod 4, not the ISO week
   number mod 4**, which is what COMM-315 offered as an example. An ISO year
   has 52 or 53 weeks, so the week-number form repeats a category two weeks
   running at every 53-week year — 2026 is one, and the concrete boundary
   (2026-W52, 2026-W53, 2027-W01) is asserted directly rather than argued.
2. **The privacy filter has two halves and needs both.** Every candidate
   passes `can_view_profile_field()` *and* has the relevant toggle true read
   from the raw `profiles` column. The helper short-circuits to true for an
   admin before it reads any toggle, so on its own it filters nothing for
   exactly the caller most likely to be publishing; the columns on their own
   cannot see a block edge. Both halves were mutation-tested separately —
   deleting the column reads fails three admin assertions, deleting the
   helper calls fails the block assertion.
3. **The publish-post choice is an authorless `POST_ANNOUNCEMENT`**, the
   first producer that post type has ever had, not COMM-225's
   comment-on-a-card pattern. That pattern needs a source post, and three of
   the four categories have none.
4. **The category is derived at publish, not passed.** Publishing somebody
   the shortlist did not contain *is* a coach's pick. `admin_actions.after_data`
   keeps both the recorded `category` and the week's `rotation_category`, so
   an auditor can see when the two differed.

**Three gaps left open, not papered over:** the consistency category reads
`feed_leaderboard`, which reports the streak **as of now** and takes no as-of
date, so publishing a months-old week under that category credits a
present-day streak; `show_attendance` and `show_prs` both default **false**,
so in a club where nobody has opted in, two of the four categories will
legitimately show the empty state most weeks and the coach's-pick fallback
will carry the feature; and nothing notifies the chosen member, which the
ticket does not ask for.

| Table / function | Boundary to assert |
|---|---|
| member_of_week_category(date) | `IMMUTABLE`, reads no table. Five consecutive Mondays give the four categories in order and then the first again. The cycle is exactly 28 days wide across 600 Mondays running from 2020 — six years *before* the epoch — which also proves the `((x % 4) + 4) % 4` form really handles a negative offset rather than falling off the `case`. Three consecutive Mondays across the 2026/2027 ISO boundary get three *different* categories, with the fixture dates first verified to really be ISO weeks 52, 53 and 1. |
| member_of_week, no client write | `authenticated` has `select` and nothing else; `anon` has nothing. Exactly one policy on the table and it is a SELECT policy (asserted by reading `pg_policy`, so a later addition fails rather than slipping in). A plain member, a **coach** and an **admin** each get 42501 on insert/update/delete respectively, and the row count is unchanged after all three tried. This is the boundary the whole ticket rests on: the once-per-week rule, the adjacency refusal, the category resolution and the audit row would all be bypassable by a direct insert. |
| member_of_week, club-wide read | A plain member who is the subject of none of the five published weeks reads all five, and reads all five celebratory posts through the ordinary `post_visible_to_viewer()` rule with no special case. Publishing means public. |
| Staff gate on both functions | Both are executable by `authenticated` — the `is_staff()` test is in the body, not in the grant, so a coach who is not an admin can still call them — and a plain member gets P0001 `not authorized` from both. `anon` and PUBLIC hold execute on neither; PUBLIC is asserted separately, since a new function starts with execute granted to PUBLIC. `member_of_week_candidate_set` is revoked from every role including `authenticated`: it carries the privacy filters but no staff gate of its own, because both callers have one. |
| Candidates, consistency_streak | The member with the **longest** streak is absent because `in_leaderboards` is off, and a second member is absent because `show_attendance` is off — the third gate inherited from `feed_leaderboard`, since the ranked value is attendance-derived. What is left is ordered by streak and carries the number. Asserted for a coach and again for an **admin**, where `can_view_profile_field()` filters nothing and only the column reads are doing the work. |
| Candidates, most_prs | The member with **10** PRs that week is absent (`visible_to_club` off) and the member with **5** is absent (`show_prs` off); the answer is the member with 3. Both would have been at the head. The count is 3 and not 7, because four of that member's PRs are in the week before — the window is `coalesce(occurred_on, created_at::date)` in `[week_start, week_start+6]`. Another member counts 1 and not 2 because their second PR that week is `only_me` and `post_visible_to_viewer()` keeps it out. |
| Candidates, challenge_completion | The member with **two** completions that week — the most of anyone — is absent because `in_leaderboards` is off. One candidate counts 1 and not 2 because their second completion is on a **draft** challenge, which would have put them at the head had it counted; another counts 1 and not 3 because one completion is outside the week and one is `withdrawn`. |
| Candidates, blocks | A member stops being suggested the moment they block the calling coach — a block the coach did not make, in the direction they did not make it. This is the half of the filter no column read can do, and it is why `can_view_profile_field()` is kept alongside the columns rather than swapped for them. |
| Candidates, coachs_pick and the empty state | The coach's-pick week returns `free_selection: true` and an empty shortlist — by definition, not by exhaustion. A PR week nobody logged a PR in returns zero candidates **and still names the category**, which is what the `אין מועמדים השבוע לקטגוריה זו` state needs. Two identical calls return an identical envelope: the order is total (value, display name, id). `p_week_start` null means this week, and the envelope's `week_start`, `category` and `rotation_index` are all checked against the current ISO Monday. |
| Candidates writes nothing | `member_of_week` is empty after every read above. This is the draft half of COMM-309's generated-draft/staff-publishes shape; the club sees nothing until a human publishes. |
| No two consecutive weeks | The member published in week N is refused in week N+1 with P0001 `member was recognised last week` — and the refused member was **not on that week's shortlist at all**, so the call could only have arrived as a hand-made coach's pick and is still refused. Then the two-sided proof: the same member is published again two weeks later, because the rule is about **adjacency**, not repetition. The shortlist also drops last week's member before the server would have to refuse them, and the envelope reports them as `previous_week_user_id`. |
| One publish per week | A second call for a published week raises P0001 `week already published` and leaves **nothing** behind — same member on the row, same row count, same post count, same audit count. Not an upsert, deliberately, unlike `weekly_recaps`: the post has already reached the feed. A **mid-week date** (the Friday of that week) collides with the same row rather than opening a parallel week, which is the normalisation working. Underneath, the `unique (week_start)` constraint and the `isodow = 1` CHECK are asserted directly as the superuser — the only caller they can ever have, since there is no client write path. |
| visible_to_club at publish | A member hidden from the club is refused with P0001 even as a free coach's pick and even though the calling coach can see them perfectly well. Read from the column, not `can_view_profile_field()`, for the same reason as the shortlist. |
| Reason handling | Trimmed, control characters stripped (the same `0x01`-`0x08`/`0x0B`-`0x1F` class `post_create` strips, because this text reaches the club feed), **capped** at 500 rather than rejected — asserted in one publish that sends 600 characters, a leading `chr(7)` and surrounding whitespace. Required and only required when the resolved category is `coachs_pick`: a computed category publishes fine with an empty reason, because the category *is* the reason. |
| The category is derived, not passed | Publishing a member who is on the week's shortlist records the rotation category; publishing one who is not records `coachs_pick`, asserted on a consistency week whose chosen member could never be on that shortlist (`show_attendance` off). That is the ticket's "staff can fall back to coach's pick" empty state, expressed as a fact about who was chosen. |
| The celebratory post | Read off the row, not the migration text: `post_type = 'POST_ANNOUNCEMENT'`, `author_id` **null**, `visibility = 'club'`, `status = 'active'`, `source_type = 'announcement'`, `source_id` = the `member_of_week.id`, `occurred_on` = `week_start`, `metadata` carrying `member_id`, `category`, `week_start` and a non-empty `title` (which `renderAnnouncementPostCard` reads *first*), and a body naming the member. `club` is verified as a real target by having another member read all five posts through `post_visible_to_viewer()`. |
| admin_actions | One row per successful publish and none for any of the five refusals, each with `action_type = 'member_of_week_publish'`, `target_type = 'member'`, `target_id` the recognised member, `admin_id` the publishing coach, and `after_data ->> 'category'`. **For qa:** the count has to be read past `admin_actions`'s own policy — it is gated on `community.analytics.view`, which a coach does not hold, so an authenticated count reads 0 for the wrong reason. 0045 uses a `security definer` helper in the `tests` schema for exactly this. The `action_type` CHECK gained its twelfth value here, the first widening since 202608280002; `target_type` was not widened, since `'member'` already fits. |
| member_of_week category CHECK | A closed list of the four rotation categories, asserted as the superuser, so a typo cannot invent a fifth that no rotation week would ever produce. |

## Phase 4 tickets, Registration & invite management

ID range COMM-370 to COMM-381. Ticket files are in
`docs/community/tickets/`. Filed from a direct product-owner ask (not one
of the P0/P1 spec sections a prior phase mapped from): a complete
per-person invite system alongside the existing shared per-role code, plus
an admin/coach management screen covering invite/code management, a member
roster, editable onboarding-step copy, and registration-funnel analytics.

**Build order: schema first, all six of COMM-370 through COMM-375, exactly
the "schema leads each phase" pattern every earlier phase followed** —
every client-facing ticket in this phase calls at least one function from
this cluster. Within schema, COMM-370 and COMM-371 have no ordering
constraint against each other (different tables, different permissions);
COMM-372 depends on COMM-370 (`invites` must exist before
`redeem_invite_code` can read it); COMM-373, COMM-374, and COMM-375 are
each independent of the others but COMM-375 additionally reads the tables
COMM-370/371 create. Recommended concrete order: COMM-370, COMM-371,
COMM-372, COMM-373, COMM-374, COMM-375. After that: admin-moderation's four
screens (COMM-376 through COMM-379, no ordering constraint against each
other), identity-privacy's COMM-380 (small, unblocked once COMM-372 ships),
then qa's COMM-381 last, the phase's merge gate, the same role
COMM-191/234/317/338 played for every earlier phase.

### schema

| ID | Title | Agent | Status |

| COMM-373 | Editable onboarding step content | schema | done |

| COMM-375 | Registration funnel analytics RPC | schema | done |

**All six were sitting at `review` through the rest of this phase's build
and are promoted to `done` here** — a bookkeeping gap COMM-381 found and
closed, the same shape COMM-234 found for the Phase 2 challenges cluster:
the pgTAP was real and passing throughout, the status column had simply
never been bumped past the pre-client-build checkpoint. The five client
tickets they gate were correctly unblocked the whole time. Built 2026-09-03
as migrations 202609030001 through
202609030006, with pgTAP 0056 through 0061. `supabase db reset` applies
every migration clean and `supabase test db` passes 63 files / 2274
assertions locally, with no regression in any of the 55 pre-existing
suites.

`docs/community/contracts.md`'s "Needs from schema, registration and
invite management (Phase 4)" section has been **rewritten to describe what
shipped**, per this file's standing rule that contracts reflect final
reality rather than the original proposal. Read that section, not this
one, for exact signatures. The paragraphs below record what changed from
the pre-build proposal and why.

**The one root cause behind four of the five signature deviations.** Every
proposed signature in this cluster was written against `public.invite_codes`
*as it looked in 202608270003* — a plaintext `code text primary key` with a
`^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{4,32}$` CHECK. That column has not existed since Phase 0:
`202608270006_security_hardening.sql` dropped it ("Replace plaintext invite
codes with opaque IDs and hashes"), replaced it with `code_hash`, re-keyed
the table on a uuid `id`, and left `redeem_invite_code` refusing anything
outside `^[a-f0-9]{40,128}$` before it looks in any table. So the proposed
8-character per-person code and the proposed hand-picked "print it on a
flyer" shared code could each have been minted, handed to a real person,
and never redeemed — and making them redeemable would have meant widening
that format gate for the whole redemption path, which is exactly the online
guessing surface 202608270006 closed. Hashing a short code would not have
helped either: 36^8 unsalted sha256 candidates is minutes on one GPU, so
the real choice was never "plaintext versus hash" but
"short-and-plaintext-equivalent versus long-and-opaque". Both new code
minters therefore reuse `create_member_invite`'s existing 24-random-byte
hex generator byte-for-byte. The upside is large and was not obvious in
advance: because a per-person code now has the *same shape* as a code the
signup field already accepts, COMM-372 needed **no change to the format
gate at all**, and COMM-380 stays the copy-review-only ticket it was scoped
as. The cost, stated plainly: a raw code is retrievable exactly once, from
the create call, and never again — neither list function returns a `code`
key, so `label` (per-person) and `id`/`created_at` (shared) are what tell
two rows apart.

**COMM-370.** `public.invites` shipped as specified except for
`code_hash text not null unique` in place of the proposed plaintext `code`
column, per the above. RLS enabled with **zero policies and zero grants** —
the same shape `invite_codes` and `invite_attempts` hold; RLS on with no
policy is deny-all, so the table is unreachable, which is the outcome the
"every table gets a policy" rule protects. `admin_invite_create` returns
`jsonb` rather than the `public.invites` row type, because a row type
cannot carry a value that is not a column and the one-time code reveal is
the whole point of the return value. `admin_invite_list` carries no `code`
key for the same reason. One function was added that the proposal did not
name: `invite_status(revoked_at, redeemed_at, expires_at, now)`, immutable,
the single definition of the four-state lifecycle, read by
`admin_invite_list`'s filter *and* its returned `status` key *and*
`registration_funnel`'s two as-of-now counts — so no two surfaces can
disagree about what "pending" means. Its precedence is redeemed > revoked >
expired > pending: what happened to an invite beats a deadline it never
reached.

**COMM-371.** The user outcome ships in full — an admin can see every
shared code, how many people joined through each, create one, and turn one
on or off, all from the app. Three signature deviations, all forced rather
than chosen: no `p_code` parameter (codes are server-generated, per the
above); `set_active` is keyed on the uuid `id` rather than a text code,
which also lets the audit row carry a real `target_id` and corrects the
proposal's note that it would have to be null "since `invite_codes`'
primary key is text" — it has been a uuid since 202608270006; and
`p_role = 'coach'` is refused with its own error, because
`redeem_invite_code`'s shared branch still inserts the literal `'member'`
(202608270006: "Ordinary redemption never grants or upgrades to coach") and
COMM-372 leaves that branch untouched, so a coach shared code would be a
guaranteed-dead row. Coach access keeps its two live paths:
`admin_grant_coach` on an existing member, and a per-person coach invite.
`redemption_count` is read from `invite_redemptions` and is deliberately a
*different* number from `use_count` — the latter is the rate-limit counter
the redemption path bumps, the former is how many people actually joined;
0057 asserts they differ rather than assuming they agree.

**COMM-372.** Both overload signatures are unchanged, and the one-argument
wrapper was not redefined at all — it already delegates with a null actor
key, so it picked the widening up for free. The shared branch is
byte-for-byte 202608280013 and still runs first. The one correction to the
proposal is the new column: `invite_redemptions.invite_id` could not be
reused as specified, because it already exists, is NOT NULL, and points at
`invite_codes(id)`. Shipped instead is a separate nullable
`person_invite_id -> invites(id)`, `invite_id` relaxed to nullable, and
`check (num_nonnulls(invite_id, person_invite_id) = 1)` — satisfied by
every existing row with no backfill, and giving `registration_funnel` a
total, disjoint partition to count on. The per-person branch claims its
invite with a single `UPDATE ... RETURNING` rather than a read-then-write,
so two simultaneous redemptions of one code cannot both win. It grants the
invite row's own role, member or coach, which is the cluster's one real
privilege widening and is deliberate: the row names one person, was minted
by a named permission holder, is audited on creation, and is single-use.

**COMM-373.** Shipped as proposed, with two additions found while building.
The pin trigger pins **`step`** as well as `updated_by` and `updated_at`:
`step` is the primary key and the client holds UPDATE on the whole row, so
without it a staff member could rename a card and break this ticket's own
"five rows always exist" criterion through the one grant that *is* given.
The audit trigger skips two cases — a session-less update (`log_admin_action`
raises on a null `auth.uid()`, so a service-role copy fix would otherwise
fail outright) and an update that changed neither title nor body (the pin
trigger rewrites `updated_at` every time, so every idempotent save from the
editor screen would otherwise log a change that did not happen). One seed
detail worth knowing before COMM-378 renders it: **`first_week` and
`first_month` are seeded with their fixed title and an *empty* body.** That
is the byte-for-byte-correct seed, not an omission — both of those cards'
visible bodies are computed entirely at render time today, so there is no
fixed lead copy to move, and seeding one would change what a member sees.
The empty string is where a staff-authored standing lead can go later,
which is what the "computed sentence appended after this table's body"
split is for. Also worth knowing for the editor screen: a member's UPDATE
against this table **does not raise** — a failing RLS `USING` clause on
UPDATE makes the row invisible and matches zero rows, so the client must
verify by reading back, not by catching an error.

**COMM-374.** Shipped as specified, returning `table(...)` rather than the
proposed `setof jsonb` — the ticket's own migration outline said table, and
it makes the "exactly `admin_search_members`' shape" claim checkable by the
type system; 0060 asserts the two `pg_get_function_result` strings are
byte-identical. One addition: `profiles.id` as a tie-break after the
coalesced join date, because that date is not unique (a club that imported
its members shares one timestamp across many rows) and a cursor paginator
whose sort key repeats can loop or skip rows.

**COMM-375.** Shipped exactly as proposed, response shape included. Its two
as-of-now invite counts route through COMM-370's `invite_status()` so the
dashboard and the invite screen cannot disagree. Two behaviours COMM-379
should render rather than "fix": `redeemed` can legitimately exceed
`invites_issued` and `redeemed_rate` can exceed 1 (the denominator is
per-person invites only, per open question 7, while the numerator counts
every account) — 0061 asserts that shape holds; and "profile completed"
deliberately does not filter `deleted_at`, because a member who completed
their profile in a period and later left still completed that step, and
excluding them would silently rewrite a past period's funnel every time
someone deletes their account.

**One privilege boundary flagged for confirmation, built as specified.**
`invites.role` admits `coach` and `community.member.invite` is seeded to
`coach`, so a coach can mint an invite that makes a stranger a coach — and
coach is a real elevated tier (`is_staff()` gates the roster, attendance
reads and the coach tools). That is what COMM-370's acceptance criteria and
open question 6's chosen default jointly specify, and it is audited on
creation, so it was built rather than quietly narrowed. Narrowing it later
is a one-line CHECK change plus a permission re-seed. Related: open
question 6's parenthetical, "the same tier `community.member.restrict`
already uses", does not describe the live mapping —
`community.member.restrict` is seeded to `head_coach`, `admin` and `owner`
only, not to `coach`. The explicit role list in the ticket was built, and
it does include `coach`.

**A pre-existing production bug found while building COMM-374, and fixed:
`admin_search_members` has never worked.** It raised `42702 column
reference "id" is ambiguous` for *every* caller including a real admin,
from 202608270011 (Phase 0) until `202609030007`. The function is declared
`returns table(id uuid, ..., is_admin boolean, ...)`, and in PL/pgSQL those
OUT parameters are in scope for the whole body, so `where id = auth.uid()
and is_admin and deleted_at is null` in its own authorization guard is
ambiguous three times over; PL/pgSQL's default `variable_conflict = error`
refuses rather than guessing, and refuses *before* the permission check can
pass or fail — which is why the failure has always looked like a permission
denial. `admin_grant_coach` and `admin_revoke_coach` carry the
byte-identical guard and were always fine, because they return void and so
have no OUT parameters to collide with; that is exactly why the defect
survived a copy-paste into three functions. It went unnoticed because every
existing test asserts only the *refusal* path for a non-admin, and a
non-admin got an exception either way, just with a different SQLSTATE than
the one asserted — there has never been an assertion that an admin gets
rows back. The fix aliases the table in the guard; signature, returned
columns, query, ordering, limit and grants are all unchanged, so no client
needs to change. This is filed under Phase 4 because **COMM-377 is
specified to reuse this exact surface** (its row renderer and the
`admin_grant_coach`/`admin_revoke_coach`/`GRANTABLE_ROLES` machinery), and
COMM-376 through COMM-379 should be built against the fixed version. pgTAP
0062 leads with the assertion that was missing for the defect's whole life.
Worth a separate look by `qa` during COMM-381: the same "OUT parameter
shadows a column in a guard" shape may exist in other `returns table(...)`
definer functions in this schema.

### admin-moderation

| ID | Title | Agent | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| COMM-376 | Invite and code management admin screen | admin-moderation | done |
| COMM-377 | Member roster screen | admin-moderation | done |
| COMM-378 | Onboarding step content editor | admin-moderation | done |
| COMM-379 | Registration funnel analytics screen | admin-moderation | done |

All four are client-only, no migration. COMM-378 (onboarding-content
editing) is assigned here rather than to coach-tools: it is admin console
content management in the same shape as this cluster's existing pinned
content and announcement/analytics surfaces, not a member-relationship
action in the shape coach-tools' own tickets (Welcome, Congratulate,
Engage, Member of the week) all are. COMM-377 explicitly reuses the
existing member-search row renderer and the existing
`admin_grant_coach`/`admin_revoke_coach`/`GRANTABLE_ROLES` role-change
machinery rather than rebuilding it — the roster is a new browse entry
point onto member management that already exists, not a second
implementation of it. COMM-379 shares COMM-310's dashboard shell and
period selector rather than adding a second one.

**All four shipped 2026-09-04, client-only, against the fixed
`admin_search_members` and the final Phase 4 signatures in
`contracts.md`.** Three new client-side permission strings were added to
`PERM` in `cloud.js` (`MEMBER_INVITE`, `INVITE_MANAGE_CODES`,
`CONTENT_MANAGE_ONBOARDING`), gating both the nav/render entry point and
nothing else — every actual write still goes through the RPC that holds
the real boundary, matching COMM-150's rule that a client gate only hides
a control the server would refuse anyway. `npm test` is green: 1015 tests
across 60 community-\* files (44 new tests added across the four new
files below), no regressions in any pre-existing suite.

**COMM-376.** Two independent panels in one `renderInviteManagement()`
section, each self-gating and returning `""` when its own permission is
absent, so a coach who holds `community.member.invite` but not
`community.invite.manage_codes` sees the per-person panel only — the
outer section itself renders nothing only when *both* are absent. The
shared-code create form offers **no role selector at all**: `p_role` is
always sent as `"member"`, because `admin_invite_code_create` refuses a
coach-role shared code unconditionally (COMM-371's own DEVIATION — not
even an admin can create one), so there is nothing to disable, only
something to never offer. The per-person create form's coach radio is
rendered only for `isAdmin()`; a coach sees the member radio plus an
inline note that a coach invite needs an admin, matching the
`202609030008` narrowing exactly (`community.member.invite` alone is only
sufficient for `p_role = 'member'`). Both create flows reveal their raw
code exactly once, in a dismissible card, with a copy-to-clipboard action
— the ticket's own acceptance criteria only asked for this on the
per-person panel, but the same "neither list function returns a `code`
key" fact from `contracts.md` applies identically to a shared code, so the
shared-code form got the identical one-time reveal rather than leaving an
admin with no way to ever read a freshly minted code back. Revoking a
pending per-person invite goes through the module's standing
`askConfirm()` destructive-action pattern; the server's `'already
redeemed'` refusal surfaces as its own Hebrew sentence rather than the
generic failure copy, per the ticket's own acceptance criterion.

**COMM-377.** `renderMemberManagement()`'s row markup was split into a
shared `memberManagementRowHtml(m, opts)` plus a `memberRoleButtonsHtml(m,
readOnly)` helper, so the roster and the existing search screen call the
exact same renderer — `opts.readOnly` disables (with a tooltip) the role
buttons for a staff-but-not-admin viewer, and `opts.showRemove` hides the
destructive remove-member control on a roster row, since neither the
ticket's acceptance criteria nor product intent asked for a "remove a
member" affordance on a plain browse view. Gate is `is_staff()`
client-side, matching `admin_member_roster`'s own looser AUTH versus
`admin_search_members`'/the role-change RPCs' `is_admin()`.

**A real, flagged gap found while building COMM-377, worked around rather
than papered over.** `admin_member_roster` sorts and paginates on
`coalesce(invite_redemptions.redeemed_at, profiles.created_at)` but its
`returns table(...)` never exposes that coalesced value or
`profiles.created_at` — only `redeemed_at`. For a profile with no
`invite_redemptions` row at all (mid-signup, or a pre-invite-gate legacy
account), the value the RPC actually sorted and filtered on is invisible
to the client, so there is no way to construct a correct `p_cursor` for
the page after one ending in such a row. Resending a `null` cursor is not
a fix: the function reads `p_cursor is null` as "no lower bound at all"
and restarts from the very top, which would loop the same rows forever
rather than advance. The shipped behaviour (`loadRoster()` in `cloud.js`)
is to stop offering "load more" the moment a page's last row has
`redeemed_at == null`, rather than resend a cursor that cannot possibly be
correct — every row already fetched is real, correctly ordered, and never
duplicated; the only cost is not reaching further into a club's legacy
tail in one browsing session. A real fix is a small schema addition (a
`sort_key timestamptz` column in the return, or exposing
`profiles.created_at` directly) and is one line of migration plus a
one-line client change once it ships — filed here rather than invented
around, per this file's own "flag it, don't paper over it" rule.

**COMM-378.** `cloud.js`'s five `renderOnboarding*Step()` functions now
read `title`/`body` from `state.onboarding.stepContent` (loaded once for
*every* signed-in member, not just staff, at boot alongside
`loadOnboardingProgress()` — the table's read policy is `using (true)`,
and every member's own onboarding card depends on it, not only the
editor). Each falls back to today's exact hardcoded Hebrew string while
the table has not loaded yet, which is byte-identical to COMM-373's own
seed, so there is no flash on a slow load. `welcome`/`first_class`/
`third_class` have no computed line at all — the table's `body` **is** the
whole card. `first_week`/`first_month` prepend the table's `body` (empty
on today's seed, so today's screens are pixel-identical to before) before
their own untouched computed sentence (the active-challenge line, the
sessions/PRs/achievements summary), never after, matching the "computed
line appended after the editable lead" split `contracts.md` describes.
The editor itself lists all five rows with the `field()`/`setFieldErrors()`
pattern per row (`formId = "onboardingEdit_" + step`), and — because
`contracts.md` documents that a refused `UPDATE` under this table's RLS
`USING` clause never raises, only matches zero rows — every save re-reads
the row and compares it against what was just sent before declaring
success, surfacing "the save didn't go through" rather than a false
positive. A save's own draft is seeded from the loaded row lazily, once,
and only cleared on a verified successful save, so a failed save (network
or the read-back mismatch) never discards what a staff member typed.

**COMM-379.** Appended inside `renderAdminAnalyticsDashboard()`'s own
populated branch, immediately after COMM-311's `renderMemberSegments()`,
sharing the exact period selector and load cycle — `loadRegistrationFunnel()`
fires from inside `loadAdminAnalyticsDashboard()` the instant its own
`a.data` becomes truthy, unawaited, the same precedent COMM-311 set. The
funnel renders as four ordered rows, each carrying its own count and (from
the second row on) `registration_funnel()`'s own already-computed
step-over-previous-step rate — `redeemed_rate`, `profile_completed_rate`
and `verified_rate` are rendered verbatim, never re-derived, and a `null`
rate (a genuine zero-denominator, e.g. no redemptions this period) renders
through the module's existing em-dash convention rather than being
omitted the way the funnel's own first row (which has no previous step to
compare against, structurally) is. Shared-code activity and per-person
invite counts render in two separate supporting cards, with a
footer-note spelling out that `invites_issued` counts per-person invites
only — so `redeemed` legitimately exceeding it, and a rate legitimately
exceeding 100%, render as the honest (if unusual) numbers
`registration_funnel()` returns, never clamped. Gate matches the RPC's own
`community.analytics.view or is_admin()` pair exactly, deliberately
narrower than COMM-377's `is_staff()` — a coach who can browse the roster
is still refused here, asserted directly against the same seeded coach in
the new test file.

### identity-privacy

| ID | Title | Agent | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| COMM-380 | Signup screen supports per-person invite codes | identity-privacy | done |

Small on purpose: `redeem_invite_code`'s signature does not change
(COMM-372), so the existing code-entry screen needs no new field and no
new branch. This ticket is the copy review and the end-to-end test for the
new code path, plus confirming the generic "invalid" error copy still
reads honestly now that it also covers a spent per-person invite.

**Shipped as a copy review plus one real client bug fix, not a pure copy
review.** The Hebrew copy needed no change: `redeemCode()`'s existing
generic "קוד ההזמנה שגוי, פג תוקף או נוצל" ("the invite code is invalid,
has expired, or has already been used") already reads honestly for a
never-issued code, a spent one, an expired one, and a revoked one — a
revoked invite reads fine under "invalid," the same way a deactivated
shared code already did before this ticket, and COMM-372's own
anti-enumeration acceptance criterion means the server will never
distinguish revoked from the other three anyway. What did need to change:
`redeemCode()`'s success check was hardcoded to the literal string
`"member"`, which was equivalent to "did the RPC succeed" only because,
before COMM-372, a shared code could never grant anything but `'member'`
(COMM-371's own coach-shared-code refusal). COMM-372 grants a per-person
invite's own role, member **or coach**, so a real, successful coach-invite
redemption came back as the string `"coach"` and the old check
(`data !== "member"`) misread it as a failure — showing the generic
invalid-code error for a redemption the server had already committed
(the invite row claimed, single-use, via `UPDATE ... RETURNING`, per
COMM-372) and could never be retried, since the code was already burned.
Fixed by checking for the literal `"invalid"` instead of the literal
`"member"`, which makes the client's success path match the RPC's actual
three-way contract instead of a two-way contract that stopped being true.
New coverage: `test/community-person-invite-redemption.test.mjs`, one test
for a successful coach-role per-person redemption (asserts the invite-code
screen is gone and no field error shows) and one for a genuinely invalid
code (asserts the existing generic error still shows and the screen does
not advance). `test/security-hardening.test.mjs`'s pre-existing "the invite
UI handles invalid and rate-limited results" test asserted the old
`data !== "member"` string directly; updated to assert `data === "invalid"`
instead, since it was pinning the bug rather than the behavior it meant to
protect.

### qa

| ID | Title | Agent | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| COMM-381 | Phase 4 QA sweep and merge gate | qa | done — see summary below |

Last, depends on every other Phase 4 ticket.

**COMM-381, the Phase 4 QA sweep and merge gate, DONE.** Cross-referenced
every Phase 4 ticket's (COMM-370 through COMM-380) acceptance criteria
against the real `cloud.js`/migration/RLS code, not just this file's own
prose, and re-verified all three CI jobs independently from a genuinely
fresh state, the same discipline COMM-234/317 held for Phase 2/3.

**Full test suite, re-run fresh, not trusted from any earlier agent's own
report.** `npx supabase db reset` applies all 84 migrations clean;
`npx supabase test db` (real Docker Postgres, not mocked): 63 files / 2276
assertions, all pass. `npm test`: 1022 tests, 1021 pass / 1 skipped / 0
failed on a clean run. One run under load hit a single `waitFor timed out`
failure in `test/community-moderation.test.mjs` ("the report sheet lists
the six reasons..."); re-run in isolation it passed cleanly in under a
second — the same confirmed-flaky-infra-not-a-regression class this file's
own notes describe for earlier sweeps, verified rather than assumed here.
`scripts/browser-check/run-all.mjs`: 28/28 green, up from 27 (see below).

**The one real gap this sweep found and closed itself, per the ticket's own
acceptance criterion #3: no end-to-end browser check of the full per-person
invite lifecycle existed.** COMM-381's own acceptance criteria explicitly
ask for "an admin generates one, a new signup redeems it, the admin sees it
flip to redeemed with the right identity attached, and a second redemption
attempt on the same code is refused" via real Chromium — nothing in
`scripts/browser-check/` covered it. Added
`scripts/browser-check/community-person-invite-lifecycle.mjs`, following
COMM-317's own `community-monthly-recap-publish.mjs` precedent for a
multi-actor scenario, but in ONE Chromium page rather than two separate
browser launches, because the two actors here need to share the same raw
code and the same underlying invite row across an identity switch — real
sign-out, a real fresh anonymous signup, a real credentials upgrade, and a
real sign-back-in with a password, exactly the sequence a real device would
drive. `test/helpers/mockSupabase.mjs`'s built-in `redeem_invite_code` knows
nothing about `public.invites` (it always answers `"member"`), so this
script registers its own small, faithful in-page stand-in for
`admin_invite_create`/`admin_invite_list`/`redeem_invite_code`'s per-person
branch, sharing one `invites` array across every step — the real Postgres
functions are already proven exhaustively by pgTAP 0056/0058; this proves
the CLIENT'S OWN continuity, which nothing else did. Building it surfaced a
genuine ordering fact about `renderCommunityApp()` this sweep had assumed
wrong on a first draft: right after a per-person code redemption the
session is still anonymous, so the render shows the `#communityCredentials`
(username/password) screen *before* `#communityProfile`, not after — a
draft that skipped it hung waiting on the wrong element forever. Also
surfaced, and worth any future browser-check author knowing:
`ensureCommunityDataLoaded()`'s own comment already documents that
`loadFeed()`'s success calls `setMessage("")`, racing `saveProfile()`'s own
success message on the exact same field — "whichever finished last silently
won" — so this script asserts on `.subtabbar` appearing (a non-racy signal
that every gate has passed) rather than on the "הפרופיל נשמר" toast text,
which a real Chromium run can and did lose to that documented race.

**A bookkeeping gap, the same shape COMM-234 found in Phase 2.** All six
schema tickets (COMM-370 through COMM-375) had been sitting at `review`
since 2026-09-03, even though the backlog's own schema section already said
"Built ... `supabase db reset` applies every migration clean and
`supabase test db` passes 63 files / 2274 assertions" — the tests were real
and passing the whole time, the status column had simply never been bumped
past the pre-client-build checkpoint once the five client tickets landed on
top of them. Promoted all six to `done` here, in the schema table above and
in each ticket's own file.

**A second, much smaller cosmetic-but-real gap, fixed:** a test title in
`test/community-onboarding-content-editor.test.mjs` read "a coach without
community.content.manage_onboarding never sees the editor entry point," but
its own fixture role was `"member"`, not `"coach"` — and
`community.content.manage_onboarding` is seeded coach-and-above
(202609030004), so there is no such thing as an actual coach who lacks it.
The assertion was always correct (a plain member sees nothing); only the
title claimed to test a case that cannot exist. Retitled to "a plain member
never sees the editor entry point"; no behavior change.

**Permission gating, the phase's own stated focus, re-verified per screen
rather than assumed from the tickets' own reports.** Each of the four
admin-moderation screens already carries a real, executing test proving a
plain member gets neither the UI entry point nor a fired RPC, matching the
exact server rule: invite management (`test/community-invite-code-
management.test.mjs`, split two ways — `community.member.invite` coach-and-
up for the per-person panel, `community.invite.manage_codes` admin/owner-
only for the shared-code panel, and the 202609030008 coach-role-invite-
requires-admin narrowing asserted with its own dedicated radio-visibility
test), member roster (`test/community-member-roster.test.mjs`, `is_staff()`
— deliberately looser than `admin_search_members`'/the role-change RPCs'
`is_admin()`), onboarding editor (`test/community-onboarding-content-
editor.test.mjs`, `community.content.manage_onboarding` or `is_admin()`),
and registration funnel (`test/community-registration-funnel.test.mjs`,
`community.analytics.view` or `is_admin()` — explicitly narrower than
`is_staff()`, asserted against the same coach fixture that CAN see the
roster). Every RPC-side boundary these client tests assume is separately
proven at the real-Postgres level by pgTAP 0056/0057/0059/0060/0061, not
merely mirrored in a mock.

**Worth a separate look, flagged rather than fixed here, matching this
file's "flag it, don't invent around it" rule.** `cloud.js`'s `isAdmin()`
helper reads the raw `profiles.is_admin` boolean; the server's
`public.is_admin()` (202608280001) is `role_rank(my_role_code()) >= 50`,
and `my_role_code()`'s own comment says it resolves "the highest-ranked of
the redeemed role and the legacy `is_admin` flag" — so a real `owner` or
`admin` account reached via an `invite_redemptions.role` value rather than
the flag would pass every server `is_admin()` gate (including COMM-370's
coach-role-invite narrowing and COMM-371's shared-code creation) while
`cloud.js`'s `isAdmin()` would still read `false` for them, hiding controls
a real owner is actually allowed to use — the same "client gate doesn't
quite match its own RPC" shape COMM-374 found and fixed in
`admin_search_members`. Not fixed here, for two reasons: it is not
reachable through anything Phase 4 (or, so far as this sweep found,
anything else client-side) ever writes — `GRANTABLE_ROLES` caps a
client-driven role grant at `head_coach`, so `invite_redemptions.role` can
only ever become `'admin'`/`'owner'` via a direct service-role/dashboard
insert, never through the app — and it predates this phase entirely,
already tracked under Phase 1's own COMM-150 ("`isStaff`/`isAdmin` helpers
stay as thin conveniences over the permission set and role rank, with a
comment that the server is the authority"), which `cloud.js`'s `isAdmin()`
does not yet honor. Fixing it here would mean auditing every one of
`isAdmin()`'s dozens of pre-existing call sites across the whole module,
well outside this phase's remit; filed here for whoever picks COMM-150 back
up.

**The "OUT parameter shadows a column in its own guard" bug shape COMM-374
flagged for a separate look (the exact defect that broke
`admin_search_members` for its entire life) does not recur elsewhere.**
Checked every `returns table(...)` `language plpgsql` `security definer`
function in the schema: `coach_inactive_members`/`coach_new_members`
qualify every guard and query reference with a table alias (`pr.id`, never
bare `id`); `admin_member_roster` (COMM-374 itself) was built with that
lesson already applied and never references a bare column at all in its
guard; `feed_page` explicitly declares `#variable_conflict use_column` at
the top of its body, a deliberate, different defusing of the same class of
collision. No second instance found.

**Open questions and contracts.md, confirmed rather than assumed.** All
seven of this phase's own open questions (no default expiry; a shared-code
revoke is non-retroactive; the generic `'invalid'` anti-enumeration answer;
one `admin_actions` row per onboarding edit, no version table; no literal
step reordering; `community.member.invite` seeded coach-and-above, narrowed
to admin-only for a coach-role invite by 202609030008; `invites_issued`
counts per-person invites only) match what actually shipped, read directly
off the migrations rather than off this file's own prose.
`docs/community/contracts.md`'s Phase 4 section was checked line by line
against the final migrations and is consistent — every DEVIATION it
documents is real and matches the shipped signature.

**Full WCAM re-review, checked rather than defaulted, per the ticket's own
"checked, not defaulted" instruction.** None of the four Phase 4 client
screens fires a single `track(...)` analytics event — grepped `cloud.js`
for any WCAM-relevant call site touching invite management, the roster, the
onboarding editor or the funnel dashboard and found none. All four are
staff/admin surfaces (moderation-style actions or passive reads), exactly
the "adds no new member-facing participation event" case the ticket
predicted; no `docs/community/metrics.md` change was needed and none was
made.

### Open questions for this phase

Numbered separately from the running "Open questions for the user" list
below since they are scoped to this phase; each was given a reasonable
default and built against, per this planning session's own instruction to
not block on them, the same posture Phase 3's own open questions (11-14
below) were given.

1. **Should a per-person invite expire by default?** Built with no default
   expiry (`expires_at` nullable, null meaning "never expires") — an admin
   can set one per invite via `admin_invite_create`'s optional parameter,
   but nothing forces it. Confirm whether a standing default (7 days, 30
   days) should apply when the admin does not specify one.
2. **Does revoking a shared code retroactively affect anyone?** No.
   COMM-371 builds it exactly like today's unexposed behavior: deactivating
   a code only stops future redemptions, existing `invite_redemptions` rows
   are untouched. Confirm this is the intended meaning of "revoke" for a
   shared code, since it is a softer action than COMM-370's per-person
   revoke (which can only ever target an *unredeemed* invite in the first
   place).
3. **Should a spent per-person invite give a distinguishable error?**
   Built to return the exact same generic `'invalid'` a wrong guess
   returns (COMM-372), preserving `redeem_invite_code`'s existing
   anti-enumeration property. The alternative — telling a real person
   "this invite was already used, contact your coach" — is friendlier but
   means the function can no longer treat "never existed" and "already
   spent" as the same answer, which is the property the throttle design
   leans on. Confirm the generic-answer default is acceptable, or accept
   the friendlier, distinguishable version as a deliberate trade against
   that property.
4. **Should onboarding-content edits be versioned or audited beyond the
   standing `admin_actions` log?** Built with the same one audit row per
   edit every other staff content change in this schema gets
   (`onboarding_content_updated`, before/after in the audit blobs) — no
   separate version history table, no diff view. Confirm that is enough,
   or that a full edit history is wanted for a screen only staff sees.
5. **Should onboarding steps be literally reorderable?** Not built as
   asked literally — see COMM-373's own note: each of the five steps'
   timing is tied to a real-world trigger (join date, elapsed days,
   attendance count), and `cloud.js` already documents the current fixed
   precedence as a deliberate anti-reorder decision from COMM-222/COMM-316
   ("letting an attendance milestone occupy that slot ahead of welcome
   would be exactly the reorder effect the ticket's own criterion asks
   this file to avoid"). This phase ships copy editing only. Confirm that
   satisfies the ask, or specify what reordering would concretely mean
   given each step's trigger is fixed (for example: a display priority
   used only as a tie-break on the rare day two steps become due at once,
   which the current one-slot design does not currently need since only
   one step is ever "due" at a time by construction).
6. **Who should be allowed to generate a per-person invite?** Built at
   `community.member.invite`, granted coach and above (the same tier
   `community.member.restrict` already uses) — a coach can invite someone
   without needing an admin. Confirm that tier, versus keeping invite
   generation admin-only like the shared-code controls.
7. **`registration_funnel`'s `invites_issued` denominator.** Built to
   count per-person invites only, since a shared code has no "issued"
   event (COMM-375's own note). Confirm this reading, or specify a
   different unified denominator (for example, treating every shared-code
   redemption as also "issued" at the moment of redemption, which would
   make `invites_issued` and `redeemed` for that bucket always equal and
   the funnel's first step less informative for a club that mostly uses
   the shared code).

## Open questions for the user

Logged by planner while writing tickets.

Resolved 2026-08-28:
- Item 2 identity: recoverable and required. Verified email plus password
  before or right after invite redemption. RLS requires
  `profiles.recovery_verified_at`. See COMM-016.
- Item 3 missing tables: approved. Land as small migrations per owning Phase 1
  ticket, no Phase 0 widening. `recovery_codes` is dropped, COMM-016 uses a
  `recovery_verified_at` column instead.
- Item 5 club model: approved. Keep `club_id`, one club row, no multi-tenant.
- Item 6 friends: approved. Friends means mutual follows.
- Item 8 birthday: approved. No birth date field. Celebrate keeps anniversary
  only.

Resolved 2026-08-30:
- Item 1 attendance source: self-reported. Attendance is a member logging
  "I trained today" (a session/workout log entry standing in for a class
  check-in), not an Arbox integration and not a dedicated in-app class
  check-in flow. This unblocks the parked bucket and the seven Phase 3
  tickets gated on it; the actual attendance-log mechanism and the
  `ATTENDANCE_RECORDED` trigger_type's real source still need building
  when Phase 3 gets there, but the *source* question is settled.
- Item 4 reaction label: keep the current generic wording. No club-specific
  Hebrew term. The database value already stays generic either way.
- Item 7 direct messaging: not deferred, removed from scope entirely. No
  "Message" button exists anywhere in the shipped client today (checked —
  it was only ever a spec reference, never built), and none should be
  added. WhatsApp covers private contact between members.
- Item 10 web push: confirmed. VAPID keys will be provisioned when Phase 2
  reaches web push; the iOS installed-PWA-only limitation (Safari 16.4+)
  is accepted.

Resolved 2026-08-31 (planning pass, no code):
- Item 1's mechanism half. The *source* was resolved 2026-08-30
  (self-reported). The *mechanism* — the table and the write path — did not
  exist as a ticket until this pass: it is now COMM-300, a new ticket
  number ahead of COMM-301, not a renumbering of any of the 17 existing
  Phase 3 titles. See "attendance foundation" under Phase 3 tickets above.
  Nothing here is built yet — this closes the planning gap, not the
  engineering one.
- Item 11 (COMM-311/312/313 spec gap): proceed with each ticket's own
  conservative, best-effort proposed shape rather than waiting for real
  spec text. Build against it now; revisit the actual output once it
  exists.
- Item 12 (COMM-315 category rotation): use the proposed rotation as-is —
  consistency, PRs, challenge completion, coach's pick.
- Item 13 (COMM-314 retention window): 30 days, matching the existing
  `purge_due_accounts()` window.
- Item 14 (Phase 3 analytics review): fold into COMM-317. COMM-317's own
  acceptance criteria gain an explicit full WCAM re-review, the same role
  COMM-234 played for Phase 2 — no new ticket number minted.

Still open: item 9 (recap scheduling note — awareness only, not a decision
that blocks anything), and four new ones raised while writing Phase 3
tickets, numbered 11-14 below.

1. Attendance data source. Still unpicked. It gates the whole parked bucket
   and seven Phase 3 tickets. Options: pull from Arbox, an in-app class
   check-in, or self-reported "I trained today".
2. Disposable versus recoverable community identity. COMM-016 needs this to
   finish Phase 0 for identity-privacy. Recoverable means adding account
   linking through a verified method. Disposable means a clear loss notice
   before invite redemption.
3. Phase 0 schema list is missing tables that Phase 1 tickets need:
   `hidden_posts` and `saved_posts` (COMM-108), a `parent_comment_id` and
   `edited_at` column on `comments` (COMM-121, COMM-122), `pins` (COMM-155),
   `posting_restrictions` (COMM-153), `notification_batches` (COMM-142),
   `invite_attempts` for the actor throttle (COMM-017), and `recovery_codes`
   if identity is recoverable (COMM-016). Recommendation: schema lands these
   as small Phase 1 migrations at the start of each owning ticket, rather
   than widening Phase 0. Confirm that approach.
4. Reaction label. The spec wants a club-specific term in the style of a
   fist bump. Current plan keeps the existing wording. Give a Hebrew term or
   confirm keep as is.
5. Club model. Spec tables carry a `club_id`. This product is one club.
   Recommendation: keep `club_id` columns, default them to a single club
   row, do not build multi-tenant. Confirm.
6. Friends versus following. Spec uses both words. The repo has one-way
   follows and blocks, no mutual-friend object. Recommendation: "friends"
   maps to mutual follows for leaderboard and visibility scoping. Confirm.
7. Direct messaging. Spec section 92 defers full messaging, section 20 marks
   the Message button P2. Plan does not schedule it in Phase 2 or 3.
   Recommendation: keep deferred, WhatsApp covers private chat. Confirm.
8. Birthday in the coach Celebrate section needs a birth date on the
   profile, which the app does not collect. Options: add an optional birth
   date field with `show_birthday` privacy, or drop birthday from Celebrate
   and keep anniversary, which uses member-since.
9. Weekly recap scheduling. A Supabase free project pauses after a week
   idle. A live club stays active so this is low risk, noted for awareness.
10. Web push provider. Phase 2 web push needs VAPID keys and a push service,
    and iOS support is installed-PWA only on Safari 16.4 or newer. Confirm
    the team will provision VAPID keys and that iOS coverage limit is
    acceptable.
11. Member engagement segmentation, community health score, and retention
    correlation views (COMM-311, COMM-312, COMM-313) have no forward
    reference anywhere in this repo's docs, unlike every other Phase 3
    ticket. Each ticket file proposes a conservative, best-effort shape and
    flags it explicitly. Recommendation: confirm the real spec text for
    these three (segment set and thresholds, health-score formula and who
    sees it, cohort window and correlation cuts) before a feature agent
    builds against the proposed shape.
12. Member of the week (COMM-315) has the same gap: no forward reference,
    a proposed category rotation (consistency, PRs, challenge completion,
    coach's pick) this planner invented from the title alone. Confirm or
    correct before build.
13. Abandoned-profile retention window (COMM-314). `purge_abandoned_profiles`
    was already named in `docs/community/contracts.md` as a Phase 3 stub,
    but no number of days for "abandoned" appears anywhere. Recommendation:
    pick a number (30 days, matching the existing `purge_due_accounts()`
    explicit-deletion window, is a reasonable default to confirm or
    override) before COMM-314 is built.
14. Phase 3 has no dedicated analytics ticket the way Phase 2 had COMM-233.
    Every Phase 3 ticket that adds a real surface names its own
    `metrics.md` update inline in its acceptance criteria instead (COMM-300,
    COMM-304, COMM-307, COMM-309, COMM-315), but nothing plays COMM-233's
    role of reviewing the whole set together and re-checking WCAM inclusion
    once every Phase 3 producer exists. Recommendation: either fold that
    review into COMM-317's QA sweep explicitly (COMM-317's own acceptance
    criteria do not currently name a full WCAM re-review), or confirm a new
    ticket number should be minted for it — this planner did not invent one
    on its own, since it was not among the 17 titles given.

## Design sync & audit remediation (2026-09-02)

Filed from `2026-09-02-design-sync-and-cross-repo-audit.md`, a 10-agent cross-repo audit comparing this repo against `crossfit-pwa-Noam` (design reference) for visual-design parity and portable improvements, plus a top-to-bottom review of security, accessibility, performance, architecture, test coverage, and legal/content readiness. Full findings and rationale for every ticket below live in that audit doc. P2/informational findings (50 more) were intentionally left unfiled — see the audit doc's Proposed tickets sections per domain if you want those ticketed too. Two P1 findings (Noam's stale PRIVACY.md/TERMS.md and its unused cloud.js/cloud-config.js carrying live Supabase credentials) are not filed here since they belong to the `crossfit-pwa-Noam` repo, not this one's ticket system — see the audit doc directly.

COMM-369: CHANGES.md's top entry was stale at 2026-08-27 while `git log`
(reconstructed from `.git/logs/HEAD`, since no live `git` execution was
available in this pass) showed real work through 2026-09-01. Backfilled six
new entries, newest first, covering 2026-08-28 through 2026-09-01: two
2026-09-01 grab-bags (small independent fixes, and the hamburger-nav/
Settings/desktop-sidebar UI restructuring), then one entry each for the
Phase 3, Phase 2, and Phase 1 builds, and a Phase 0 foundations entry. The
Phase 1/2/3 entries are sourced from this backlog file's own narrative
paragraphs for those phases (the authoritative record of what each ticket
actually delivered), not invented; the two 2026-09-01 UI-restructuring
entries, which have no matching narrative here since that track sits outside
the Community ticket system, are sourced from commit messages only and kept
correspondingly shorter. CHANGES.md's top entry now matches the latest
commit prior to this session's own work.

COMM-334: closed by direct verification, not assumption. A local checkout of
`haimunia-app`'s real `origin/main` was available in this workspace after
all, at `crossfit-pwa-Noam` (its `origin` remote points at
`github.com/haimuniya/haimunia-app`, not the Noam design-reference content
its directory name suggests). `git show origin/main:index.html` and a direct
`curl` against the live `https://haimuniya.github.io/haimunia-app/` both
confirm production ships the same kind of meta-tag CSP this demo repo does,
on the same GitHub-Pages-cannot-send-headers limitation — the "production
ships no CSP at all" claim in this repo's own `index.html` comment was
wrong, not verified. That comment is now corrected in place, and this demo's
meta tag gained the `frame-ancestors 'none'` line production already had
(inert in meta form on either app, real fix tracked separately as
COMM-337).

COMM-335 is `done`: the previous pass left PRIVACY.md/TERMS.md structurally
complete but with ~13 bracketed placeholders (`[Operator legal name]`,
`[Contact email]`, `[Jurisdiction / governing law]`, `[Hosting region]`,
`[Backup retention period, in days]`, `[Log retention period, in days]`,
`[Minimum age requirement]`, etc.) marking facts nobody in this workspace
could supply, because there is no real legal entity behind this app to
supply them. The product owner clarified directly: this is a single
CrossFit box's own app, run by its coaching team for their own members, not
a company with a registered identity, jurisdiction, or compliance
department — so this pass replaced every placeholder with honest, generic
language instead of inventing a fake company, address, or governing law.
Concretely: "operator" throughout both documents now reads as "the coaching
team," with an explicit "there is no separate company/legal entity" line
rather than a name and address; "contact `[Contact email]`" became "contact
your coach directly" everywhere, since that is the real, already-established
private-contact channel (the same WhatsApp/direct-contact path COMM-230/231
already document — there never was a support inbox to point to, so pointing
at a fake one would have been worse than admitting there isn't one);
`[Jurisdiction / governing law]` was dropped rather than replaced — the
documents now say plainly that no particular country's law or courts are
claimed to govern them, since there is no entity to make that claim, and
disclaimer language that previously leaned on "the laws of X" now just says
"applicable law"; `[Hosting region]` became the real, verifiable technical
fact instead of a legal claim — Supabase's actual `ap-southeast-1`
(Singapore) hosting region (confirmed against this workspace's own
supabase-live-project record), stated as infrastructure fact, not a
jurisdiction assertion; the backup/log retention placeholders became honest
non-numeric language ("follow our hosting provider's own standard
backup-rotation and log-retention windows... we don't separately extend
those windows or track them by an exact day count") since no real day count
exists to state, while the one retention fact that IS real — the 30-day
post-deletion purge window — stayed as a concrete number because it was
already true; and `[Minimum age requirement]` became a plain 13, stated
explicitly as "a general baseline we chose as a reasonable policy, not a
number required by a specific law that applies to this app," rather than a
fabricated jurisdictional minimum. COMM-336's disclosures (photos, comments,
follows, the admin-visible member directory, the attendance admin-override)
are preserved unchanged through this pass. Separately, both documents were
previously linked live from Settings as raw `.md` files opened in a new
browser tab (`app.js`'s "משפטי" block, `href="./PRIVACY.md"` /
`href="./TERMS.md"`, `target="_blank"`) — unstyled, no theme, no RTL — so
this pass also added `privacy.html` and `terms.html` at the repo root: real
standalone pages that load `theme-init.js` (same dark/light/auto behavior as
the rest of the app, stamped before first paint), self-host the same Rubik
and Anton `@font-face` declarations, and reuse the app's own design tokens
by literal value (`--bg`, `--surface`, `--border`, `--chalk`, `--steel`,
`--brass`, `--shadow-card`, the `--stripe` gradient) rather than inventing
new ones, with each policy section rendered as a `.chart-card` — the same
grouped-card component index.html already uses elsewhere, not a new visual
language. The page shell (`<html lang="he" dir="rtl">`, header, "חזרה
לאפליקציה" back link) matches the app's Hebrew/RTL chrome; the policy prose
itself stays in English, as it already was in the source `.md` files (this
pass did not translate it), so the prose sits inside its own `dir="ltr"`
island — the same isolation pattern `index.html`'s `.mono` class already
uses for non-Hebrew content — rather than being force-flowed right-to-left.
`app.js`'s two Settings links now point at `privacy.html`/`terms.html`
instead of the raw `.md` files. PRIVACY.md/TERMS.md remain in the repo as
the plain-text source of truth (nothing auto-generates the HTML from them,
by design — this stays build-free per this repo's own stated philosophy);
to keep the two formats from silently drifting apart, `test/community-
legal-pages.test.mjs` asserts both formats agree on every load-bearing fact
(no leftover bracket placeholders, no draft/review language, the "no
separate legal entity"/"contact your coach directly" language, the 30-day
deletion window, minimum age 13, and the `ap-southeast-1` region) rather
than diffing full prose, which would be too brittle. `npm test` passes
including the pre-existing `community-backup-sync.test.mjs` assertions
against PRIVACY.md's automatic-backup paragraph, which was left unchanged
by this pass. What remains genuinely out of scope, per the ticket's own
acceptance criteria: an actual founder/legal sign-off is still recorded
outside this repo if the product owner ever forms a real legal entity later
— nothing here claims that sign-off happened, only that the documents no
longer contain placeholders standing in for facts nobody could supply.

COMM-338 is `partial`: two of its three acceptance criteria were already
true, not newly shipped here — confirmed again by re-reading
`.github/workflows/test.yml`'s `migration-check` job (unchanged since
COMM-332 re-verified it) rather than re-running the full docker-based
`supabase test db` stack a second time in one day. The pgTAP suite
(`supabase/tests/`, 56 files) runs on every push against a disposable,
migration-only database, and that step has no `continue-on-error` — a red
RLS test fails the build. What did not exist before this pass is the
multi-role live smoke test: `scripts/smoke-test-multi-role.mjs`, following
the exact convention `scripts/smoke-test-anon-key.mjs` already established
(deliberately outside `npm test` and outside CI, run by hand against a real
project's Auth/REST endpoints over the network) — but generalized to five
real signed-in roles (anonymous, member, coach, admin, and a
posting-restricted "blocked" member), each asserting its own real
permission boundary (own-row reads, `admin_grant_coach` refused for
everyone but an admin, a restricted member's `post_create` refused, an
admin's `mod_queue` reachable). The real gap: there is no separate staging
project distinct from production (see `docs/community/` "supabase-live-
project" memory) and no test accounts are provisioned anywhere yet, so this
session did not execute the script against a live project — doing so
without staging risks writing test data into the one real project this app
has. Each of the four credentialed roles is skipped, not failed, when its
`SMOKE_<ROLE>_EMAIL`/`_PASSWORD` env vars are unset, so the script is honest
about never having been run for real rather than reporting a false pass.
Provisioning five throwaway accounts (one per role) on a real or staging
project and actually running this once before the next go-live is the
remaining work, and is a decision (and a credential-handling step) for the
project owner, not something this pass could complete unattended.

COMM-362, COMM-363 and COMM-364 are `done`. COMM-362:
`test/community-session-expiry.test.mjs` adds two tests exercising both
halves this ticket asked for. The sync/write path: `post_create` returning
the 401/"JWT expired" shape a real unrefreshable expired token produces
keeps the composer open with the existing retryable error
(`publishComposer()`'s own `if (error || !data)` branch), never a silently
dropped post. The realtime-subscribe path: a session dying mid-session from
a refresh failure — not a user clicking sign out — still closes every open
realtime channel (the COMM-141 own-row notification channel) and drops the
app back to the signed-out gate, through the exact same
`onAuthStateChange(SIGNED_OUT)` handler every sign-out test already
exercises via the UI button. `test/helpers/mockSupabase.mjs` gained one
small addition for this, `expireSession()` — fires the identical
`SIGNED_OUT` event `signOut()` does (real gotrue-js makes no distinction
between the two triggers either), named separately purely so a reader does
not mistake a dying session for a user action. COMM-363:
`scripts/browser-check/community-post-composition.mjs` composes and
publishes a post through the real composer UI end to end (real `fill`/
`selectOption`/`click`, not synthetic events), and
`community-report-moderation.mjs` reports a post as one member, switches to
a head-coach session, and reviews and removes it through the real
moderation queue — both against real Chromium, bringing the suite from 24
scenarios to 26 (`run-all.mjs`: 26/26 passed). The "report" control turned
out to live inside the post's "⋯" overflow menu, not directly on the card —
worth noting since it is easy to seed a post and never find the button.
COMM-364: `test/storage-quota-exceeded.test.mjs` mocks `dbPut()` rejecting
with a real `QuotaExceededError` and asserts `noteStorageError()` surfaces
the dedicated out-of-storage Hebrew message (not the generic one), that a
genuinely different failure gets the generic message instead (no
mislabeling), that the failure is still logged, and that a later successful
save clears the error state — all through `saveSet()`'s real save path,
never throwing past it. Not ported to `crossfit-pwa-Noam` in this pass — that
is a separate repo outside this workspace, per this ticket's own optional
"if kept in sync" wording, and not something this session touched.
`npm test`: 946 tests, 942 passing before and after this pass's own 9 new
tests (5 in the two files above, plus the pre-existing 3 unrelated failures
below); browser-check: 26/26. The 3 pre-existing `npm test` failures
(`community-engagement-ui.test.mjs`, a photo-upload test, and
`community-inline-compare.test.mjs`, all asserting the exact literal
`safeText(...)` template string cloud.js used to use) are unrelated to
these four tickets — they are mid-flight fallout from another concurrent
session's uncommitted COMM-367/COMM-368 `esc`/`safeText` consolidation
(`src/shared/safe-helpers.js`), caught here rather than papered over, and
belong to that work to fix, not this one.

The four "unassigned (app.js core, outside the 15-agent community roster)"
P1 tickets are now done, closed together in one pass since none of the four
touch Community feature code (all pure app.js/index.html core, `COMM-328`'s
territory, not any of the 15 feature agents' surfaces).

COMM-339 was exactly as filed: `closeSettings()` now resets `confirmClear`
alongside `settingsOpen`, and calls `render()` (the same thing
`ask-clear`/`cancel-clear` already did) so `#settingsBody` — kept current on
every `render()` regardless of the overlay's open state — actually reflects
the reset before the sheet can be reopened, rather than leaving stale
"armed" markup sitting in the DOM until some unrelated action re-rendered
it. Pinned in `test/design-sync-audit-app-core.test.mjs`.

COMM-340 was already fixed: `interactive-widget=resizes-content` landed on
`index.html`'s viewport meta as part of e5fe413's own P0 pass, just never
had the ticket's own status bumped off `todo`. Verified present and pinned
with a source assertion in `test/design-sync-audit-app-core.test.mjs`, since
nothing pinned it before.

COMM-349 is a real duplicate, not busywork: it was filed by a second,
independent audit pass over the same gap COMM-328 (done) already closed.
Its own acceptance criteria is narrower than its title suggests — just
"verify COMM-328's acceptance criteria explicitly include the `[href]` ->
`a[href]` selector narrowing before closing both" — and both are: all 8
dialogs are registered on app.js's own `APP_DIALOGS` (`registerAppDialog()`
calls for `picker`, `wodPicker`, `wodBuilder`, `achievements`,
`celebration`, `notifications`, `onboarding`, `welcome`, alongside the
pre-existing `navMenu`/`settings`), and `appDialogFocusables()`'s selector
already reads `a[href]`, not a bare `[href]`. No code change was needed,
only verification — now pinned by two source assertions in
`test/design-sync-audit-app-core.test.mjs` so a future edit can't quietly
regress either fact. Worth flagging: COMM-349's own title ("migrate ...
onto Community's dialog registry") describes `CLOUD_DIALOGS`
(cloud.js's Community-feature dialog registry), but the dialogs it's
actually about are app.js's own core training-log overlays, migrated onto
app.js's own `APP_DIALOGS` by COMM-328 — a separate, parallel registry with
the same contract, not `CLOUD_DIALOGS` itself. The ticket file's own
"Dependencies: COMM-328" and "Location / evidence: Same locations as
COMM-328" already point at this; only the title is imprecise.

COMM-360 is the one real code change of the four, and the most invasive of
this batch. `selectedId` stays a real movement id internally (ladder mode,
superset partner switching, and `saveSet()`'s `exerciseId` all need one),
but a new `movementExplicitlyChosen` flag (default `false`, mirroring
Noam's own reference implementation) is now the real "has the user actually
picked one" signal: `choosePickedMovement()` (the picker) and
`startEditEntry()` (opening a real past set is as explicit a choice as
picking one) are the only two places that flip it true, and `saveSet()`
refuses to save while it's false. `selectedWodId` needed no equivalent flag
— nothing internal depends on it always being a real WOD — so it now
defaults to a real `null`, same as Noam. Both reset on `clearAllData()`.
The WOD half turned out to need zero rendering changes: `renderWodLogSection()`
already returned a `<div class="empty">בחרו אימון כדי להתחיל</div>` for
`!wodById(selectedWodId)` and the bottom-bar visibility check already
conditioned on `wodById(selectedWodId)` — both apparently written
defensively ahead of this ticket — so flipping the default to `null` alone
makes the existing empty state and hidden save button kick in. The
movement half needed real changes since no such gate existed:
`renderLogTab()`'s `.exercise-select` button now shows a generic "מה עשינו
היום?" prompt instead of naming a movement when unchosen, followed by a
`<div class="empty">בחרו תרגיל כדי להתחיל</div>` in place of the
rx-toggle/date/stat-row/steppers/ladder block (today's cross-exercise log
summary at the bottom is unaffected — it isn't about any one movement), and
`render()`'s bottom-bar visibility/label logic now checks
`movementExplicitlyChosen` the same way it already checked
`wodById(selectedWodId)` for the WOD tab. `saveWod()` picked up the same
`if (!w) return;` guard Noam's own version already carries ("no WOD chosen
yet ... but defend anyway") — ours didn't have it, and needed it once
`selectedWodId` could genuinely be `null`. Four existing tests asserted the
old default-selected behavior as their premise and needed updating to pick
a movement/WOD first (matching what a real user now must do), not because
what they were actually testing changed: `test/audit-ux-fixes.test.mjs`'s
auto-backup-before-wipe test, `test/clear-data.test.mjs`'s
stale-ladder-after-wipe test, and `test/wod-save-button-pinned.test.mjs`
and `test/wod-subtab.test.mjs`, both of which had "by default" baked into
either their title or their premise and are now explicit about picking
first. Seven `scripts/browser-check/*.mjs` scenarios shared the same stale
assumption (a movement or WOD is always pre-selected) and were updated the
same way, then re-verified for real against local Chromium (this session
had a working Playwright/Chromium install, unlike some earlier sessions
noted elsewhere in this doc): `duration.mjs` and `benchmarks.mjs` needed an
explicit pick added; `emom.mjs`, `wod-extras.mjs`, `wod-builder-duration.mjs`,
and `text-scale.mjs` needed one too, factored into a new shared
`selectBenchmarkWod()` helper in `scripts/browser-check/lib/actions.mjs`
rather than repeating the same three-line benchmarks-subtab dance four
times; `ladder.mjs`, `superset.mjs`, and `roadmap.mjs` already picked a
movement explicitly as their first action and needed no change. `npm test`
and a full `node scripts/browser-check/run-all.mjs` pass both confirmed
green after. New coverage for the ticket itself lives in
`test/design-sync-audit-app-core.test.mjs`. One overlap worth flagging for
whoever picks up COMM-343 ("port the chosen/unchosen exercise-select state
and stat-hero cards"): this ticket already had to add a minimal
chosen/unchosen split to `renderLogTab()` to satisfy COMM-360's own
acceptance criteria, using the plain `.empty` class rather than Noam's
`.log-empty-hint`/`.ex-sel-*` chrome — COMM-343 is still the one that owes
the real visual treatment (stat-hero cards, the dedicated empty-hint
component), it just now has a functional gate already in place to build
that chrome on top of, not a bare stub.

**COMM-352 is done.** `--text-scale` is back as a real custom property
(`1.2`) instead of a hardcoded `zoom:1.12`. `scripts/browser-check/text-
scale.mjs`'s own comment ("large is 1.2x") turned out to be leftover
evidence the intended magnitude was always 1.2 — the code had silently
drifted to 1.12 without the comment (or Noam's reference value) being
updated, exactly the kind of drift the audit flagged. Restored to 1.2
rather than keeping the smaller regressed value.

**COMM-361 is done, with a new automated check.** Light-theme `--brass`
darkened from `#A6702E` (4.22:1 on `--surface`, 3.86:1 on `--bg` — both
below the 4.5:1 AA floor) to `#956529` (5.03:1 / 4.61:1). `test/brass-
contrast.test.mjs` computes the real relative-luminance contrast from the
tokens as shipped, so a future edit to `--brass`/`--surface`/`--bg` gets
caught here instead of by eyeballing it. Dark-theme `--brass` already
cleared AA (7.25:1 / 8.69:1) and was left untouched.

**COMM-351, COMM-353 and COMM-354 are still partial, but now with a
verified, actionable cross-repo diff instead of an assumption.** An earlier
pass (2026-09-02) had no access to `crossfit-pwa-Noam` at all and could only
establish, from this repo's own git history, that Community's current value
of each token/rule was a deliberate, already-shipped decision rather than
accidental drift — it could not check what Noam actually carries. This
session (2026-09-04) had real read access to `crossfit-pwa-Noam` and used
it: read the actual current CSS on Noam's side and diffed it against
Community's, rather than repeating the earlier assumption unchecked. All
three assumptions held exactly:
- **COMM-351** (`--shadow-card`): Noam still carries the old flat-shadow
  formula (`index.html:93,116,128`:
  `0 1px 2px rgba(30,41,71,.06), 0 8px 22px rgba(30,41,71,.08)` light /
  `0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.35), 0 10px 26px rgba(0,0,0,.35)` dark). Community's
  "light rim highlight plus a soft, low-contrast drop" redesign never got
  backported. Exact 3-line diff now in the ticket file.
- **COMM-353** (`.page-title`): Noam still carries `font-weight:800;
  font-size:21px; ... margin-bottom:16px;` with no `font-family` override
  (`index.html:155`), i.e. plain Rubik/800 — Community's Anton/400+tracking
  redesign (commit `28819f7`) never got backported. Noam already has the
  `Anton` `@font-face` declared and used elsewhere, so this is a pure
  CSS-rule change on Noam's side, no new asset. Exact diff now in the
  ticket file.
- **COMM-354** (`--steel`): Noam still carries the pre-fix values
  (`index.html:85,110,122`: `#68748C` light / `#8891A6` dark) — exactly the
  values commit `e3a5a5f` moved Community away from to clear the 4.5:1 AA
  contrast floor. Confirmed real drift, in the "Noam hasn't caught up"
  direction, not a false-positive audit finding. Exact diff now in the
  ticket file.

None of these three needed (or now needs) a code change in this repo — all
three are correct and intentional here, confirmed against the actual Noam
source rather than assumed. Each ticket file now carries an exact CSS diff
(current Noam value → target value, cited by line) so whoever owns
`crossfit-pwa-Noam` can apply the fix directly without re-deriving it; that
repo could not be modified from this workspace (read-only access, and the
checkout has unrelated in-progress local changes that must not be
disturbed), so all three stay `partial` until that repo actually ships the
change.

**COMM-342, COMM-344, COMM-345, COMM-346, COMM-347, COMM-348, COMM-350,
COMM-356 and COMM-357 are done** — a batch of small, self-contained
CSS/markup fixes, shipped together since none touches the other's code:

- **COMM-342**: `cal-prev`/`cal-next`'s SVG `path` values were swapped —
  prev drew a right-pointing chevron, next drew a left-pointing one.
  Swapped back to the prev=left/next=right convention.
- **COMM-344**: the onboarding subtitle said "ארבעה מסכים" (four screens)
  while listing five rows (רישום/התקדמות/לוח שנה/אימונים/קהילה) — updated to
  "חמישה מסכים".
- **COMM-345**: `#notificationsBellBtn` had no class at all (bare inline
  styles, no background/border/shadow) while `#navMenuBtn` used
  `.icon-chip.icon-chip-steel` — the bell now carries the same class, so
  the two header icons finally match each other.
- **COMM-346**: added `.chip-btn.danger` (plus `.chip-btn.primary.danger`
  for the two full-fill confirm/run buttons) and replaced every inline
  `color:var(--red)`/`background:var(--red)` override on a `.chip-btn` in
  `cloud.js` (6 call sites: dialog confirm-yes, mod-action-run, mod-action
  item, admin-remove-member, challenge-delete draft, event-cancel-confirm)
  with the new modifier. `grep` for inline red overrides on `.chip-btn` in
  `cloud.js` now returns 0 results.
- **COMM-347**: promoted the highest-traffic classless inline components
  into real CSS classes in `index.html` — `.reaction-strip`, `.badge-tag`
  (shared by `.coach-badge` and `.pr-badge`, which keep their own class
  names for the existing test selectors/semantics but now carry no styling
  of their own), `.post-menu-wrap`/`.post-menu`/`.post-menu-item`,
  `.progress-track`, `.notif-group`/`.notif-group-body`, `.badge-grid`.
  Inline `style=` on these elements now carries only genuinely dynamic
  values (a computed width, the danger/emphasise state).
- **COMM-348**: `.post-media-grid` had zero `display:grid` rule anywhere —
  a multi-photo post's images stacked as plain blocks. Now a real 2-column
  grid, matching `.ach-grid`'s visual weight; the per-image inline
  `margin-bottom:6px` stacking hack is gone in favor of the grid's own gap.
- **COMM-350**: `.navrow.tabbtn.active` (nav-menu rows) now uses the same
  14% energy tint and `--shadow-sm` as `.tabbtn.active` (bottom tab bar),
  now that COMM-327 settled the nav IA — both are the same "which section
  am I in" idiom. `.subtabbtn` (WOD Rx/Scaled) deliberately keeps its own
  solid-pill segmented-control look, a different widget convention from a
  nav tab, not an oversight.
- **COMM-356**: the challenge/event "joined"/"completed"/"mine" pills
  (3 call sites, all the identical bug) only overrode `.admin-tag`'s
  background to brass, leaving its energy-orange text/border showing
  through underneath — a two-tone badge with no admin meaning at all. New
  `.tag`/`.tag-brass` pill used instead; `.admin-tag` itself is now only
  ever used unmodified, for real admin-context ("ניהול") labels.
- **COMM-357**: replaced every hardcoded rgba tint named in this ticket
  with `color-mix()`. `announcementPriorityBadge`'s urgent/important
  backgrounds (`rgba(194,57,44,.16)` / `rgba(166,112,46,.14)`, literal
  light-theme `--red`/`--brass` values that silently stopped matching
  their own token once dark mode changed it) are now `color-mix(in srgb,
  var(--red) 16%, transparent)` / `color-mix(in srgb, var(--brass) 14%,
  transparent)`. `announcementAccentStyle`'s urgent banner background
  (`rgba(194,57,44,.07)`) is now the same `--red` color-mix at 7%. The
  coach-comment highlight's `rgba(191,167,106,.06)` (a literal tint that
  didn't even match `--brass`'s actual RGB) is now `color-mix(in srgb,
  var(--brass) 6%, transparent)`.

**COMM-358 is done, with new test coverage.** Every `role="tablist"` group
(bottom tab bar, WOD's Rx/Scaled subtabbar, the community feed-scope
filter) now has a real roving tabindex (only the selected tab is a Tab
stop, baked into each render so a re-render can't get it out of sync) and
one shared, generic keydown handler (`app.js`) for Arrow/Home/End: Right/
Left follow the visual direction (checked via the `dir` attribute, since
jsdom doesn't resolve an inherited CSS `direction` the way a real browser
does — this app is RTL-only, so Right/Left are swapped from the LTR
default), Up/Down and Home/End are direction-agnostic, and moving focus
also switches the tab (automatic activation, matching how every tab here
already switches on click). `test/tablist-keyboard.test.mjs` covers the
roving tabindex and all four navigation keys against two of the three
groups for real, in jsdom, through the production render path — the third
(community feed scope) shares the exact same handler and is exercised
indirectly by the existing feed-client tests, which still pass.

**COMM-359 is done, with new test coverage.** `renderChart()` (the shared
SVG progression chart behind est1RM, bodyweight and body-measurement
history) now gets `role="img"` and a computed `aria-label` summarizing the
point count, first/last values and PR count — nothing assumes a unit,
since one function renders all three chart kinds. `test/chart-accessible-
name.test.mjs` checks both the multi-point and single-point cases.

**COMM-329 has more of its remaining scope closed.** The Community tab
itself now opens with `renderTabHeader("community")` — the same shared
function the other 4 solo tabs already use, reading "קהילה" from the one
`getNavItems()` registry entry rather than inventing a second name.

2026-09-04, with real `crossfit-pwa-Noam` read access, closed two more
pieces of the "Not done" list:
- `adminAnalyticsCard()` (`cloud.js`) — one shared function behind all 27
  admin-analytics metric cards — now emits `<h3 class="field-label">`
  instead of `<div class="field-label">`, the real remaining "`cloud.js`
  sub-section headings beyond `sectionHead()`" work named in the ticket.
  Every call site already nests inside a `sectionHead()` h2, so h3 is the
  correct level, no skip. Roughly 40 other one-off `.field-label`
  sub-headers scattered through invites/challenges/events/recaps/profile
  are still plain `<div>`s — a file-wide audit, not a shared-function fix,
  and stays out of scope for the same reason the original pass gave.
- A new `test/heading-outline.test.mjs` gives acceptance criterion #3 a
  real automated check (not axe — this repo has no axe-core dependency
  anywhere, confirmed by checking `package.json`/`node_modules`/
  `scripts/browser-check`; adding one is new tooling, not a fix-in-place)
  for the 4 solo top-level tabs: exactly one `<h1>` inside `<main>`, and no
  heading-level skip going deeper. The four **community** screens
  (feed/profile/challenges/admin) the criterion also names still have no
  automated scan — reaching them needs `bootCommunity()` plus admin/coach
  fixtures and in-app navigation per screen, real separate harness work.

Noam's own `.page-title`/`.ach-section-title` markup was re-checked against
the actual checkout rather than left as a stale note: still `<div
id="pageTitle">` (`index.html:155`) and `<span
class="ach-section-title">` (`app.js:1287`) — confirmed, not guessed. Stays
`partial`: see the ticket file's own updated "Not done" section for the
three items above, spelled out precisely rather than left as "unchecked."

**COMM-323 and COMM-355 are done together**, as COMM-355 required.
`crossfit-pwa-Noam` is not checked out in this workspace, so Noam's actual
`.settings-*` CSS couldn't be copied — the redesign instead reuses this
app's own established components: `.settings-pane` (a card list replacing
the old `.divider-label` + bare `.card` alternation), `.who` for the
profile card (the exact same avatar+name component the nav menu already
renders, not a near-duplicate) with a trailing `.icon-chip.icon-chip-steel`
edit button, `.settings-block`/`.settings-block-title` for each grouped
section (Appearance, cloud/backup, Data & Backup, Legal, Danger Zone — every
Community-only row preserved, nothing dropped), and `.chip-btn.danger`
(COMM-346, built alongside this ticket) for the danger-zone confirm instead
of hand-rolled inline red styles. The cloud-aware 5/30-day backup-staleness
logic (COMM-355) is byte-identical to before, just re-skinned into the new
`.settings-warn` icon+box component. `test/audit-ux-fixes.test.mjs`'s
destructive-button test used to regex-match the old inline style string;
rewritten to render the real screen and assert the `.danger` class instead.
`test/community-backup-sync.test.mjs`'s source-slice check of the threshold
logic needed no change.

**COMM-324 is done.** `crossfit-pwa-Noam` isn't checked out here either, but
the ticket's own evidence named both card classes and the footer class,
which was enough: `.wodbuild-card-details` (name/format/EMOM/time-cap) and
`.wodbuild-card-moves` (search + movement list) replace the flat
`.modal-list` layout; the "צור אימון" button moved out of the scrollable
middle section into a new `.wodbuild-foot`, a sibling of `.modal-list`
inside `.modal-sheet`'s flex column (the same structural trick
`#bottomNavWrap` uses) so it stays reachable regardless of scroll position
instead of sitting mid-form. Each `.format-chip` regained a one-line
subtitle (זמן→"כמה מהר סיימתם", etc.) — `renderWodBuilderFormats()` only
toggles classes on the existing buttons and never regenerates their
markup, so this carried no regression risk to it.

**COMM-341 is done.** `.cal-panel` now wraps the calendar's header/weekday
row/grid/legend/stats in one bordered/shadowed card, matching every other
data surface in this app; `.cal-legend` explains the grid's existing two
dot markers (plain = "יש נתונים", brass = "שיא אישי"). Since
`crossfit-pwa-Noam` isn't checked out here, the stats formula wasn't
literally "ported" from its `renderCalendarGrid()` — a real equivalent was
built instead, from the ticket's own named figures: training days (distinct
dates in the month with a strength or WOD entry), total sets (count of
strength entries — a WOD session is a different unit of work), and PR days
(distinct dates with a PR). Recomputed on every month nav the grid already
handles.

**COMM-343 is done.** Built independently in a worktree that hadn't seen
COMM-360 land yet, so its own `renderLogTab()` change guarded on
`movementById(selectedId)` and returned a `.exercise-select.log-empty-hint`
prompt for a null `selected` — on the (then-true) assumption that COMM-360
would eventually make `selectedId` itself go unset. **Corrected during this
merge**: COMM-360 shipped first and, as its own backlog note already flags,
deliberately keeps `selectedId` a real movement id always (ladder mode and
`saveSet()` need one) and uses the separate `movementExplicitlyChosen` flag
as the real "nothing chosen yet" signal instead — so `movementById
(selectedId)` can never be falsy, and COMM-343's `if (!selected)` branch was
permanently dead code with a stale comment, not temporarily dead pending
COMM-360. Removed as part of resolving the merge between the two worktrees;
COMM-360's own `movementExplicitlyChosen` gate (the `.empty` "בחרו תרגיל כדי
להתחיל" block already in `renderLogTab()`) is the one real empty-state path
and was left untouched. No test referenced the removed `log-empty-hint`
class, so nothing needed updating there. The log screen's own
est-1RM/best-hold/last-session cards get `.stat-hero` (brass accent, larger
value) — scoped to this screen, not every `.stat-card` app-wide.

COMM-365, COMM-366 and COMM-367 are `done`; COMM-368 is `partial`. All four
were done in one pass because they are the same seam: 367 removes cloud.js's
private copy of the escape, 368 gives the escape (and its eight siblings) one
home, and 365 does the same thing for the other shared surface in that file,
`state`.

COMM-367: cloud.js defined `safeText()` — the same character map, the same
null/undefined guard (`v == null` vs `?? ""`), a byte-for-byte second escape —
and used it 485 times. All 485 references now call `esc()`, and the local
definition is gone (`grep -c safeText cloud.js` → 0). Done as a scripted
identifier rewrite rather than by hand, because the two implementations were
provably equivalent and 485 hand edits are 485 chances to fat-finger one.
cloud.js binds it once at the head of its IIFE, `const esc =
window.BoxLogSafe.esc`, deliberately unguarded: an escape is the one
dependency that must fail loudly at load rather than degrade to a no-op
fallback that would ship XSS. Three test files asserted on the literal string
`safeText(...)` inside cloud.js's templates and were updated to match
(`community-inline-compare`, `community-engagement-ui` ×2) — the same three the
QA agent's own COMM-362/363/364 note flagged as mid-flight fallout from this
work; they are resolved now.

COMM-368 is `partial`, and the reason is worth being blunt about. The half
that is real and complete: `esc`, `cssSel`, `bag`, `cleanStr`, `cleanNum`,
`cleanId`, `cleanISODate`, `cleanTs` and `uid` now have exactly one definition
in this repo, in `src/shared/safe-helpers.js`, behind a named and independently
versioned module boundary (`src/shared/package.json`, `@boxlog/safe-helpers`
v1.0.0, with the `VERSION` constant inside the file kept in lockstep and
`src/shared/README.md` documenting the patch/minor/major propagation protocol).
`src/format.js`, `src/sanitize.js` and `src/constants.js` no longer define any
of them; `src/constants.js` binds them for app.js and even reads `LIMITS.idLen`
back off the shared module so `cleanId()`'s cap cannot drift. Those bindings are
`var`, not `const`, on purpose — a top-level `var` in a classic script also
publishes onto the global object, which is exactly what the `function esc() {}`
declarations they replace did implicitly, and what the jsdom harness reaches
them through (`window.esc`, `window.bag`, `window.cleanISODate` in
`test/sanitizers.test.mjs`). Equivalence was verified helper-by-helper against
the originals over a shared input corpus (including `null`/`undefined`,
non-strings, `__proto__`, over-length ids and malformed dates) *before* the
originals were deleted, not after. `safe-helpers.js` is now the first script
`index.html` loads and a REQUIRED `sw.js` precache asset — `app.js` calls
`esc()` and `uid()` unconditionally, so a miss on it genuinely does take down
the offline log, and `test/sw-precache.test.mjs`'s existing "every src/*.js
index.html loads is precached" assertion covers it automatically. New coverage:
`test/shared-safe-helpers.test.mjs` (7 tests) pins the frozen surface, that the
module is self-contained enough to run with nothing but a global object (the
property that makes it portable at all), that `package.json` tracks `VERSION`,
that no file in this repo re-declares a helper, the script ordering in
`index.html`, and that the app's bare identifiers and `window.*` globals are the
shared module's *own* function objects rather than copies.

What is NOT done, and could not be done here: `crossfit-pwa-Noam` actually
consuming it. That repo was not in this workspace when COMM-368 was
implemented — same limitation COMM-334/COMM-337 already carry, except
COMM-334 got lucky (the sibling checkout turned out to be the real
`haimunia-app`) and this one did not: the sibling repo the audit compared
against was not present at all that session.

**2026-09-04, with real read access to `crossfit-pwa-Noam`: the premise was
verified, not just re-asserted.** Read `crossfit-pwa-Noam/app.js:319-409`
(the same block the ticket cites) function-by-function against
`src/shared/safe-helpers.js` — `esc`, `cssSel`, `bag`, `cleanStr`,
`cleanNum`, `cleanId` (including `LIMITS.idLen` — 128 on both sides),
`cleanISODate`, `cleanTs` and `uid`'s two-level fallback chain are all still
byte-identical. Zero drift since the extraction. So the fork is unlinked but
not (yet) diverged — there is still exactly one correct implementation to
converge on, not two implementations to reconcile.

The ticket file now spells out the exact consuming change, since "could not
be done here" was previously the whole note: copy
`src/shared/safe-helpers.js` into `crossfit-pwa-Noam/src/shared/`, load it
via a `<script>` tag before `app.js` in `index.html` (`app.js` is currently
the sole script there besides `theme-init.js`), delete the nine local
definitions and replace them with `window.BoxLogSafe.*` bindings (the same
`var esc = window.BoxLogSafe.esc, …` pattern `src/constants.js` uses here),
add the file to `sw.js`'s `ASSETS` precache array, and re-run Noam's own test
suite. None of this was applied — this workspace can read
`crossfit-pwa-Noam` but must never modify it — but a future pass with write
access to that repo now has an exact recipe instead of "figure out how to
consume a package."
The ticket's second acceptance criterion ("a follow-up fix propagates via a
version bump instead of manual copy-paste") is therefore only half-satisfied:
the versioned artifact and the written protocol exist; the second consumer does
not. Do not close this ticket without that half.

COMM-365: `state` had 139 top-level keys — more than the ~89 the ticket
estimated — where the only thing keeping two feature clusters from colliding on
a name like `view`, `items`, `loading` or `error` was a hand-maintained prefix
convention (`feedScope`, `challengeView`, `coachCelebrate`, `modQueueStatus`).
It is now 18 per-domain namespaces (`ui`, `feed`, `posts`, `engagement`,
`members`, `club`, `leaderboard`, `admin`, `analytics`, `challenges`, `events`,
`search`, `achievements`, `notif`, `onboarding`, `recaps`, `coach`, `intro` —
the last added by the redesign's Phase 3, for the first-run intro carousel)
plus a 13-key root. The root is deliberately NOT a domain: it holds only the
session/auth/config core that every domain reads and no domain owns
(`configured`/`client`, `user`/`profile`/`redemption`, the two
localStorage-backed switches, the boot guard, the cached permission set,
`featureFlags`, `avatarUpload`). Keeping `user`/`profile`/`redemption`/
`signupStarted` flat is not laziness about the largest call-site counts — those
four are also the paths three existing source-text tests assert on by exact
string (`community-anonymous-auth`, `community-profile-gate`,
`community-username-password-auth`), so leaving them put kept the auth-gate
ordering assertions honest instead of rewriting the thing they check.

Prefixes were stripped wherever the namespace made them redundant
(`feedScope` → `feed.scope`, `challengeView` → `challenges.view`,
`coachCelebrate` → `coach.celebrate`, `notifPushSub` → `notif.pushSub`,
`adminAnalytics` → `analytics.dashboard`) and kept where they still carry
meaning (`admin.modQueueStatus`, `admin.auditFilters` — `state.admin.mod.queue`
would be a third level for no gain). 1,181 of the 1,538 `state.*` references
were rewritten; the other 357 are the root core. Done as a scripted
whole-identifier rewrite over one explicit old-key → new-path map, with the
script refusing to run at all if it met a `state.` key the map did not cover —
which is how the two keys `state.clubFeatures` and `state.clubFeaturesLoaded`
were found: both were read and written throughout `cloud.js` but never declared
in the literal, springing into existence on first write. They are declared now
(`club.features`, `club.featuresLoaded`), with defaults matching what the first
writer produced for a signed-out caller.

Three things needed real thought rather than a rename. (1) The dialog registry
did `state[key]`, which only worked because every dialog flag happened to be a
top-level sibling; each `CLOUD_DIALOGS` entry now carries an `isOpen()` getter,
so the registry stays the one place that knows where a dialog's flag lives and
`key` goes back to meaning only what it always meant to the DOM (the
`data-cloud-dialog` attribute). Nothing in cloud.js reaches state by a computed
key any more, which is what makes the static leaf check below possible.
(2) `hideMyLeaderboardResult` was absorbed into the already-grouped
`state.leaderboard` object as `.hideMine` — which turned the sign-out reset's
`state.leaderboard = { ...defaults }` into a silent bug, because that
per-device localStorage-backed flag is meant to outlive a sign-out and a
wholesale replacement would have dropped it. Caught before it shipped; the
reset now assigns leaves. (3) That sign-out reset was one 2.4 KB line of ~120
assignments, and namespacing only made it longer; it is now grouped one
namespace per line, verified first to contain no duplicate left-hand side so
the regrouping could not change the outcome.

Correctness was not left to the test suite alone. Before the swap, the old and
new literals were both evaluated and compared key-by-key through the map:
every old key's initial value present at its new path with the same shape, no
key invented, none dropped, no orphan leaf in the new literal. After the swap,
every two-level `state.<ns>.<leaf>` reference anywhere in cloud.js was checked
against the declared literal — because a flat `state.foo` that no longer exists
throws on first read, but a `state.feed.scop` typo reads `undefined` forever and
silently renders the wrong thing. Both checks are now permanent, as
`test/community-state-namespaces.test.mjs` (6 tests): the root shape, the
namespace list, the every-reference-resolves check plus its reverse (a declared
leaf nothing reads is dead state), the no-computed-key rule, the dialog
registry's key/path separation, and the leaves-never-namespaces rule for the
sign-out reset.

COMM-366 is `done` as a spike, per its own acceptance criteria — no rendering
code was rewritten. `docs/community/2026-09-03-render-architecture-spike.md`
records an explicit decision to KEEP the full-tree rerender, and it is grounded
in real Chromium measurements rather than general advice about `innerHTML`:
`scripts/browser-check/community-render-cost.mjs` is a new, re-runnable
instrument (local static server + the in-page mock backend, same rule every
community scenario follows). On a signed-in member with one loaded feed page
(20 post cards) a full `window.render()` is 27.5 KB of HTML, 274 elements, 92
focusable controls, and 0.96 ms — 3.79 ms at 4× CPU throttle (mid-range phone),
5.92 ms at 6× (low-end). The `innerHTML` write scales linearly with feed depth
with no cliff (2.06 ms at 120 cards, six pages deep), and one tap on the feed's
comment toggle costs 2 full-tab rebuilds. So the ticket's "expensive enough
that a focus-restoration subsystem exists" framing is measurably the wrong
frame: at ~4× headroom inside a frame budget, the milliseconds are not the
problem. The cost is correctness, and it is already being paid — 148 lines of
`syncCloudDialogFocus` machinery (which has to capture clicks in the *capture*
phase and serialise the clicked control into a CSS selector, because the
re-render destroys the very button that triggered it), three hand-written
"don't rerender on input, patch the counter directly" exceptions, and
scroll/`<details>`/IME state simply accepted as lost. That scales with surface
count, not feed depth. Hence: keep the model (a rewrite of 342 call sites in a
10,700-line load-bearing file has negative expected value while the budget is
met by 4×, and "state is wrong" being the *only* way the UI can be wrong is
worth real milliseconds on a codebase with no component boundaries), adopt
three guardrails, and record four trip-wires that reverse the decision (>16 ms
at 4× throttle at a depth members reach; a third hand-rolled DOM-state
restoration subsystem; a surface needing to animate across a state change; feed
virtualisation). The migration path is costed in the note's §6 so a future
ticket does not redo this analysis, and it deliberately starts from a pattern
already in this repo — `app.js`'s other four tabs are *already* scope-rendered
via `renderHistoryListArea()`/`renderCalendarGrid()`/`renderWodContent()`;
Community is the one tab that never adopted it — rather than from a framework.
Vendoring morphdom is listed last, and marked as a different risk profile
because it changes all 342 call sites at once.

One incidental finding while building that instrument, worth knowing before
someone else hits it: `test/helpers/mockSupabase.mjs`'s `feed_page()` stand-in
base64s its cursor through node's `Buffer`, which does not exist in a browser,
so it throws the moment it has any row to page and the feed comes back empty.
Every existing community browser scenario seeds `feed_page_rows: []` and never
reaches it. `community-render-cost.mjs` is the first that needs a non-empty
feed, and carries its own three-line `Buffer` shim rather than editing the
shared mock out from under the jsdom suite. A real fix belongs to whoever owns
that helper.

`npm test` across this pass: 963 tests / 962 passing before, 976 / 975 after —
the delta is exactly the 13 new tests added here (7 in
`test/shared-safe-helpers.test.mjs`, 6 in
`test/community-state-namespaces.test.mjs`), with no test lost and no
behavioral assertion weakened. The counts above are steady-state; individual
full-suite runs during this session showed between 1 and 5 `waitFor timed out`
failures that all pass in isolation and are load flakiness from three agents
running the suite concurrently on one machine, not regressions — each was
re-run per file to confirm. Nine test files were edited, all of them
source-text assertions that named a path or a helper this refactor moved
(`safeText(` → `esc(`, `state.confirmDialog` → `state.ui.confirmDialog`,
`state.feedCursor` → `state.feed.cursor`, `function cleanISODate` moving from
`src/sanitize.js` to `src/shared/safe-helpers.js`, and one that asserted two
sign-out reset assignments were adjacent lines, now rewritten to assert both
run in the same block, which is what it actually cared about). No test's
subject changed.

## Community promoted to the bottom tab bar (2026-09-04)

Direct product-owner decision, not filed as a ticket. COMM-327 (2026-09-02)
put the 4 offline training-log tabs into a fixed bottom tab bar and left
Community as the one item still inside the hamburger nav menu, reasoned as
"Community needs a full-page sub-nav of its own once signed in, not a
single tap target." Revisited and reversed: that reasoning doesn't actually
hold once you notice WOD already carries its own sub-nav (Log/History/
Benchmarks) while living in the bottom bar - "has sub-screens" was never
really disqualifying on its own.

`getNavItems()`'s `community` entry (`app.js`) is now `main: true`, same
footing as the other 4. `.tabbtn{flex:1}` (index.html) has no hardcoded
child count, so the change cost each icon ~20% width and nothing else in
CSS. Community's own on-screen subtabbar (`cloud.js`'s `.subtabbar`,
`setCommunityTab`) was already real, self-contained navigation - it never
depended on the hamburger's `.subnav` preview to be reachable, so nothing
about *how* Community itself is browsed changed, only how you first get to
it. The mobile hamburger's `onlyOther` list (app.js's `renderNavRows`) is
now empty, so the menu shows just the account card and Settings; the
desktop sidebar (`onlyOther=false`) is unaffected, since it always showed
every item regardless of the `main` split.

New coverage: `test/nav-community-bottom-tab.test.mjs` (3 tests) pins the
new bottom-bar button, the single-id guarantee (no duplicate `#tabCommunityBtn`
between the bottom bar and a now-empty hamburger list), and that the
desktop sidebar is untouched. `test/tablist-keyboard.test.mjs` needed no
changes at all - its Home/End test already computed "the last tab" from a
live query rather than hardcoding which one that was, so it silently
started asserting against Community instead of WOD and kept passing,
exactly as a well-written test should.

**Real regression found and fixed via browser-check, not the node suite**:
`scripts/browser-check/lib/actions.mjs`'s `switchTab()` helper hardcoded a
`MAIN_TAB_IDS` set that still routed `tabCommunityBtn` through "open the
hamburger menu first, click inside it, wait for the menu to close" -
correct before this change, actively wrong after it, since that id now
lives in the always-visible bottom bar. Opening the menu on top of it and
then clicking `#tabCommunityBtn` clicked an element now sitting underneath
a full-page overlay, and the subsequent wait-for-menu-to-close never
resolved. This is exactly the class of bug jsdom's node tests cannot catch
(no real hit-testing, no obscured-element detection) - every one of the 11
Community browser-check scenarios plus `boot-smoke.mjs` failed on a clean
run, while all 1036 node tests stayed green throughout. Fixed by collapsing
`switchTab()` to one path for every id (close the menu if a caller left it
open, then click directly) - now that all 5 ids are reachable the same
way, the old branch had nothing left to distinguish. `run-all.mjs`: 28/28
after the fix, 17 failing before it.

Verified: `npm test` 1035/1036 (1 pre-existing skip, 0 fail, clean run with
no flaky timeouts this pass), `run-all.mjs` 28/28. No schema change, no
migration - this is client-only.

There is no `202609060021`; the number was not used.

**Defect 1 and the contract trap it left behind.** `pr_share` and `ach_share`
were the only 2 of the client's 63 RPC names with no definition in any
migration. Both were fully wired in `cloud.js` and both answered PGRST202
from the day they shipped, so sharing a PR and sharing an achievement — the
two moments the whole community layer is built around — had never worked
once. `contracts.md` published `pr_share(record_id uuid, ...)`; the value the
client sends is `entry.id` from the offline log (`uid("set")` →
`"set-" + crypto.randomUUID()`), which never casts to `uuid`. The schema
engineer recognised the type was wrong and shipped `text`; had they followed
the published line they would have shipped a **second** outage on top of the
one they were fixing. That line is now corrected, along with COMM-105's own
"Client calls and contracts" section, which carried it too.

**Defect 1's one accepted limitation, on COMM-105.** `metadata.movement`
resolves only for a CUSTOM movement — built-in movement names are never
synced to the server, so those cards publish their numbers and fall back to
`שיא אישי`. Closing it needs a signature change carrying the name, or a
server-side catalogue of built-in movements. Neither was smuggled into
202609060019; it is written into COMM-105's acceptance criteria as a known
limitation so nobody chases it as a bug.

**Defect 3 has no UI, and that is the flagged gap.** Neither
`admin_incomplete_signups()` nor `admin_reclaim_invite()` is called from
`cloud.js`. The functions make ghost accounts findable and their invites
reclaimable; nothing yet renders them. Note the permission split any surface
must honour: **listing is `is_staff()`, reclaiming is real `is_admin()`**, and
`admin_reclaim_invite` raises four named errors (`member has a profile`,
`signup is still in progress`, `no invite to reclaim`, `cannot reclaim your
own invite`) that a UI has to surface by name, because each one means the
admin is looking at a different situation than they think.

**Two doc-level consequences worth knowing before reading anything older.**
`log_admin_action`'s five-argument form was **dropped**, not kept alongside
the new eight-argument one — `contracts.md` published the old signature until
this pass. And 202609060020 replaced `coach_inactive_members()` and
`coach_new_members()` with different `returns table(...)` shapes (DROP and
CREATE, not `create or replace`), neither of which had ever had a contract
entry; both are documented now, `state = 'no_data' | 'lapsed'` included.
