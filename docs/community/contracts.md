# Function and RPC contracts

Every Postgres function, RPC, and Edge Function the client calls is recorded
here before it is built. planner owns this file. schema updates signatures as
migrations land. Read this before adding any function. Do not call an
undocumented function.

## Conventions

- Postgres functions are `security definer` only when they must cross an RLS
  boundary, and they check the caller with `auth.uid()` first.
- RPC names are snake_case and prefixed by area: `feed_`, `post_`, `ach_`,
  `chal_`, `event_`, `mod_`, `notif_`, `pin_`.
- Edge Functions live in `supabase/functions/<name>/` and are invoked with the
  vendored client `functions.invoke`.
- Every function lists: purpose, params, returns, auth rule, side effects.
- A "direct RLS write" note means the client writes the table itself under an
  own-row policy, no function.

## Phase 0 schema notes

Landed by schema in 202608280001 through 202608280013. Read these before
writing against any of the tables below.

- The posts table is `public.workout_posts`. Tickets and this file call it
  `posts`. It was not renamed: `cloud.js` writes it by name and the reports
  query embeds it as a PostgREST related resource, which resolves through a
  real foreign key and would not survive a rename plus a compatibility view.
  Everything COMM-001 asked for is on that table.
- `post_visibility` now has five labels. `club`, `friends`, and `only_me` are
  the model going forward. `public` and `followers` are kept because the
  current client still writes them, and are read as an alias of `club` and as
  the legacy one-way follower scope. Existing rows were not remapped, so this
  migration neither widened nor narrowed anything a member already posted.
  New writes should use the three new labels. The column default is now
  `club`.
- `friends` means a mutual follow edge, resolved by `are_friends()`. There is
  no friend table.
- `post_visible_to_viewer(p_post_id uuid)` is the one place that says what
  each visibility label means. The `posts_feed_select` policy repeats the
  same rule inline and cannot call the function: the function selects from
  the same table, so a policy on it would recurse.
- Every new table carries a `club_id uuid` defaulting to
  `default_club_id()`. Nothing filters on it. It exists so a second club is a
  data migration rather than a schema rewrite.
- Community writes require `is_community_member()`, which requires
  `profiles.recovery_verified_at`. Existing email plus password accounts were
  backfilled as verified in 202608280003. Anonymous accounts were not, so
  they can read the community but cannot post, comment, react, or join until
  they set a recovery method through `mark_recovery_verified()`.
- Tables Phase 1 still needs and Phase 0 deliberately does not create:
  `hidden_posts`, `saved_posts`, `pins`, `posting_restrictions`,
  `notification_batches`, and the `parent_comment_id` plus `edited_at`
  columns on comments. Each lands as a small migration at the start of its
  owning Phase 1 ticket. All of them shipped in 202608280014 through
  202608280018, see "Phase 1 schema notes" below.

## Phase 1 schema notes

Landed by schema in 202608280014 through 202608280018. Five small
migrations, one per concern, closing the list Phase 0 deferred. Read these
before writing against any of the tables below.

- The comments table is `public.post_comments`. Tickets call it `comments`,
  the same way they call `workout_posts` `posts`. It was not renamed, for
  the same reason.
- Comment reply depth is capped at 2 by the `post_comments_depth` trigger,
  not by a CHECK, because a CHECK cannot see another row. The trigger closes
  both directions. A reply cannot be given a parent that already has a
  parent, and a comment that already has replies cannot itself become a
  reply. Without the second rule a depth-3 thread is one UPDATE away.
- `post_comments.parent_comment_id` is `on delete set null`, not cascade. A
  hard delete of a parent flattens its replies to top level rather than
  destroying other members' content. The intended removal path is the soft
  one, `status` plus `deleted_at`.
- The comment body limit widened from 280 to 1000, matching the post body
  limit and what COMM-121 and COMM-122 both specify. Widening only ever
  accepts more rows, so nothing already stored was invalidated.
- A removed or soft-deleted comment is not readable by anyone but its author
  and a `community.comment.moderate` holder. The "comment removed"
  placeholder does not need the row: a reply carries `parent_comment_id`, so
  a client holding a reply whose parent is absent from the same page knows
  to render the placeholder. No removed text crosses the wire.
- A posting restriction is applied to post creation and comment creation
  only. It is deliberately not folded into `is_community_member()`, which
  also gates challenge joins, event RSVPs, reactions, and post_media. A
  restriction is a speech sanction, not an expulsion.
- `posting_restrictions` and `pins` have a select policy and no write grant
  at all. Every write goes through a security definer function that checks
  the permission and calls `log_admin_action()` in the same transaction.
  That is what makes the COMM-153 and COMM-155 audit requirement a property
  of the schema rather than of whichever client made the call.
- The `pins` cap of 3 is a `slot` column bounded to 0 through 2 with a
  unique `(club_id, slot)`, not a counting trigger. COMM-155 says trigger.
  This is the version of that intent that survives concurrency, the same
  reasoning `post_media` used for its 0 through 3 position cap. `slot`
  doubles as the display order of the pinned strip.
- `pins.target_id` has no foreign key, because it points at one of four
  tables. Existence and pinnability are checked on write by
  `enforce_pin_target()`, and eight `unpin_target()` triggers do the job a
  cascade would have done plus the soft-delete and status cases a foreign
  key cannot see.
- `notification_batches` holds counters only. It is not a second
  notification stream. Own-row read, no write grant, so a member cannot set
  their own `next_flush_at` to now and turn the batched channel back into a
  stream of pings.
- `hidden_posts` and `saved_posts` are strictly own-row on all verbs. There
  is no count and no aggregate anywhere. Knowing who muted you is exactly
  the signal a hide feature must never leak back to the author.
- Open point for identity-privacy: `hidden_posts_self_insert` carries
  `is_community_member()`, so an account that has not set a recovery method
  cannot mute a post even though the row it would write is invisible to
  everyone but itself. The gate is there because the standing rule says
  member write paths keep it. If muting should be available earlier,
  dropping the predicate from that one policy is a one-line later migration
  and changes no other boundary.

## Phase 1 schema notes, continued

Landed by schema in 202608280020 through 202608280022, the RPCs the Phase 1
client was already built against.

- `ach_claim` is the only client-reachable way to write
  `member_achievements`, and what keeps it honest is the definition row, not
  the caller. Anything gameable from a browser is seeded
  `client_claimable: false` and stays on the `ach_evaluate` path — except
  tenure, which is seeded `client_claimable: true` but independently
  reverified server-side (202608290002) because it is derivable from
  `invite_redemptions.redeemed_at` rather than genuinely client-only. See
  `ach_claim` below.
- `comment_mentions` is a select-only table for the mentioned member and the
  comment author. A third member cannot enumerate who was tagged in a
  thread. Only the four-argument `add_post_comment` writes it.
- The mention marker in a comment body, `@[Display Name](uuid)`, is never
  parsed server-side. Parsing it would make the mention list editable
  through `comment_edit`, which is exactly the "rewrite an old comment into
  a new ping" path the posting restriction closes elsewhere.
- `post_comments.deleted_by` is what lets self-delete and moderator removal
  coexist on the same two columns. `comment_delete` stamps the author,
  `comment_moderate` will stamp the moderator, and neither overwrites the
  other because both return early on an already-removed comment.
- `post_media.decorative` plus the `post_media_normalize_alt` trigger make
  "decorative" and "has alt text" impossible to disagree in one row. A
  decorative item stores a null `alt_text`, and a whitespace-only alt text
  is stored as null so "no alt on a non-decorative image" is one queryable
  state.
- `feed_page` still builds its media objects without `decorative`. Nothing
  renders differently, because the client blanks `alt_text` for a decorative
  photo before it is stored, so the alt attribute is empty either way. The
  key is added the next time that function is re-created.

## Feed

### feed_page(cursor timestamptz, limit int, scope text) returns setof feed_item plus next_cursor

- Purpose: ranked and diversified feed page for the calling user.
- Params: `cursor` opaque token or null for the top. `limit` 1 to 40, default
  20. `scope` one of for_you, following, achievements, coach, my_classes.
- Returns: feed rows in final order, each with post fields, author, media,
  counts, plus a `next_cursor`.
- Auth: caller must have a profile and an invite redemption.
- Side effects: none. Impression writes come from the client after render.
- Notes: diversity rules from COMM-112 run inside this function. Block edges
  from COMM-125 are joined here. `my_classes` scope is still parked, and
  COMM-302 did **not** unpark it — see the last bullet below.
- Re-created in 202608310002 (COMM-301) with the same signature and the same
  output. Its relationship component is now one call to
  `relationship_score()` instead of an inline CTE; the four `v_rel_*`
  constants left its weight block and the weight `v_w_relationship = 18`
  stayed. Nothing else in the body changed, and
  `supabase/tests/0038_relationship_score_test.sql` pins the ranked order and
  the `feed_score` values to six decimal places against numbers captured from
  the pre-refactor function.
- Re-created again in 202608310003 (COMM-302, closing COMM-P01) with the same
  signature and the same returned columns. **The class-connection component
  is no longer 0.** `v_class_connection constant numeric := 0` left the
  declare block; the value now comes from
  `classmate_day_counts()`, left-joined once per distinct author in the same
  `author_facts` CTE that resolves `relationship_score()`, and is normalised
  as `least(1.0, shared_days / 8.0)` before the already-reserved weight
  `v_w_class = 6` applies. The saturation constant `v_class_saturation = 8.0`
  is new and sits with the other shaping constants; the weight itself did not
  move. Practical effect: a member the viewer trained beside on 8 or more
  days inside the trailing 60 gets the full 6 points, 4 days gets 3, no
  overlap gets 0 (a zero, never a missing term and never a raise). A member
  the viewer has blocked in either direction never reaches the scoring pass
  at all, unchanged. Pinned by
  `supabase/tests/0039_classmate_signal_test.sql`.
- Re-created a third time in 202608310006 (COMM-303) with the same signature
  and the same returned columns. **The eight weights in its weight block are
  now resolved per caller.** They stop being `constant`, keep their values
  character for character, and are passed to
  `feed_weights_resolve(auth.uid(), <the default object>)` in one new section
  placed after the auth check and before anything is scored — once per feed
  request, never once per candidate row, and fixed for the whole call the way
  `v_anchor` is. **A member with no `member_feed_weights` row gets exactly the
  ranking this function produced before**, and that is every member today,
  because nothing writes that table yet. Pinned by
  `supabase/tests/0042_personalized_feed_weights_test.sql` against the same
  three fixture posts and the same three six-decimal-place literals 0038
  captured from the pre-COMM-301 function — which have now survived three
  re-creations unchanged — asserted five times over: no row, an empty object,
  an explicit all-1.0 object, every multiplier at the 2.5 ceiling, and a row
  of junk.
- The scoring expression itself is the previous file's text **unchanged**, as
  are the candidate filters, the repetition penalty, the cursor and the row
  projection. **COMM-112 diversity still runs after scoring**, in the same
  place, against the rows the scoring query returned; personalization changes
  the score and therefore which rows reach the page, never a diversity rule.
  0042 pins that both structurally (the resolve appears before the scoring
  query and the diversity pass after it, read off `prosrc`) and behaviourally
  (a personalized feed still breaks a same-author run at two).
- **The weight block's "the positive weights sum to 104" comment was stale
  and is corrected to 110 in this migration.** 104 was the seven live weights
  while `v_w_class` was declared at 6 and multiplied by a hard 0; COMM-302
  turned that component on in 202608310003 and left the comment behind. **No
  weight moved in COMM-303** — renormalising the block down to 104 would have
  changed every existing feed score on deploy day, which is the one thing
  that ticket must not do. Nothing hardcodes the total any more: the invariant
  is "a personalized set sums to whatever the default block sums to",
  computed from the defaults at call time.
- `my_classes` stays parked deliberately even though attendance now exists.
  A class-connection **score** and a my-classes **scope** are different
  questions: `attendance_log` records days, not classes, so it carries no
  class identity to filter a post by. The scope still returns empty and the
  client still renders that chip disabled.

### member_feed_weights (table)

- Shipped in 202608310006. COMM-303.
- `user_id uuid primary key references profiles(id) on delete cascade`,
  `weights jsonb not null default '{}'`, `computed_at timestamptz not null
  default now()`. Three columns, as the ticket's outline named — **no
  `club_id`**, unlike `weekly_recaps`: the row is a private ranking artifact
  about one member, nothing aggregates it per club, and so this table also
  needs no `default_club_id()` grant.
- One addition beyond the outline: a check constraint
  `member_feed_weights_object`, `jsonb_typeof(weights) = 'object'`. The reader
  defends against a non-object anyway (it must — it also has to survive a row
  written before the constraint existed), but a column every reader treats as
  an object should not be able to hold `[1,2,3]`.
- `weights` is **multipliers relative to `feed_page`'s defaults**, not
  absolute weights: `{"relationship": 1.4, "class": 2.1}`. 1.0 means the
  default, an **absent key means 1.0**, and unknown keys are ignored by the
  reader rather than rejected, so a later ticket can start writing a ninth
  component's key before `feed_page` learns to read it. Multipliers rather
  than absolute weights because the default block has already been retuned
  twice in this module's life, and with absolute weights every stored row
  would silently become wrong the next time a default moves.
- **`'{}'` is the thin-signal answer** and is deliberately indistinguishable
  from having no row at all, so a job can record "I looked on Monday and
  found nothing" with a fresh `computed_at` without that meaning anything
  different for the feed.
- Auth: RLS on. `select` granted to `authenticated` with one policy,
  `member_feed_weights_self_select`, `user_id = auth.uid()`. **No insert,
  update or delete grant and no policy for any of the three, for anyone** —
  not the member, not an admin. The same shape `weekly_recaps` and
  `notification_batches` use, for a sharper reason: a member who could write
  here would be supplying their own ranking input, which is exactly what
  COMM-303's contract section refuses when it says the weights are "never
  passed as a parameter". The read is granted because there is nothing
  private in a member's own weights. `anon` cannot reach the table at all.
- **Nothing writes this table yet.** See `recompute_feed_weights()` below.

### feed_weights_resolve(p_user uuid, p_defaults jsonb) returns jsonb

- Shipped in 202608310006. COMM-303. **Internal, not a client call.**
- Purpose: what weights `p_user`'s feed should actually use, as an object
  with the same keys as the `p_defaults` object handed in. The one copy of
  the redistribution arithmetic.
- Not named by COMM-303's migration outline; added for the same reason
  COMM-302 added `classmate_day_counts()` beyond its own. The alternative was
  a forty-line procedural block inlined in `feed_page` where nothing could
  assert anything about it, and the invariants below are the whole substance
  of the ticket.
- **It takes the defaults as a parameter rather than holding them**, so the
  eight numbers stay stated exactly once, in `feed_page`'s weight block —
  this function owns the algorithm, `feed_page` owns the numbers, and there
  is no pair to drift. It never names a component, so adding a ninth weight
  needs no edit here.
- Returns: `p_defaults` **itself, unexamined**, when there is no row, when the
  stored value is an empty object, when it is not an object, or when every
  readable multiplier is exactly 1.0. Otherwise an object with the same keys
  and redistributed values.
- The algorithm: clamp each stored multiplier to **0.40..2.50** (COMM-303's
  worked example, adopted as the real bound), then **bounded proportional
  rescale** — repeatedly scale the not-yet-pinned components by (remaining
  budget / their unscaled total), pinning at a bound any component the scale
  would push out of range and taking its weight out of the budget, until a
  pass pins nothing. The sum is then the defaults' total by construction and
  every component is inside its bounds by construction. Neither
  clamp-then-rescale nor rescale-then-clamp achieves both; a worked
  counterexample is in the migration header.
- **And it is verified anyway before it is used**: the resolved set is summed
  and bounds-checked, and any violation returns `p_defaults` unchanged. So a
  bad stored row, or a wrong future edit to the loop, costs a member their
  personalization and never their feed. Tolerance 1e-9, nine orders above the
  rounding a single `numeric` division introduces.
- Auth: `security invoker`, **no grant to any role** — `public`, `anon` and
  `authenticated` are all revoked, the same shape `relationship_score()` and
  `classmate_day_counts()` have. Called from `feed_page` (definer, having
  already checked `auth.uid()`), it borrows those rights to read
  `member_feed_weights` past `member_feed_weights_self_select` — but only ever
  for the caller's own row, which that policy would have granted anyway. A
  client reaching it directly gets 42501.
- Unlike `classmate_day_counts()` it **does** take a user parameter, and that
  is not the same trap: it consults no privacy toggle that would silently
  ignore the argument, and no client can pass one regardless.
- Side effects: none, `stable`.

### recompute_feed_weights(p_limit integer default 500) returns integer

- Shipped in 202608310006. COMM-303. **A DELIBERATE NO-OP STUB.**
- Purpose, eventually: derive each member's multipliers from their own
  `feed_interactions` history (COMM-114) and upsert one `member_feed_weights`
  row per member. **That body is not written and is explicitly out of
  COMM-303's scope** — the ticket puts the derivation in the same "infra not
  built here" bucket as the notification batch flusher and `recap_weekly`'s
  cron gap.
- What ships is the signature, the grants, the return convention and the auth
  boundary, all pinned by 0042 now so a later ticket writes only the body. It
  is shipped rather than omitted so `feed_page` is not left reading a table
  with no named writer; it is empty rather than heuristic because a guessed
  derivation would ship unreviewed ranking to every member, and a no-op that
  writes no row cannot distort anybody's feed.
- Returns the number of member rows written — the same "rows written" integer
  `notif_batch_flush_due()` returns. **Today always 0**, so a scheduler wired
  up early gets a harmless no-op rather than an error. `p_limit` is the batch
  bound the real body will honour, mirroring `notif_batch_flush_due(p_limit)`;
  it is accepted and unused today so a scheduler's call site does not change
  when the body lands.
- Auth: `security definer`, `execute` revoked from `public`, `anon` and
  `authenticated`, granted to `service_role` only. **No `auth.uid()` check** —
  the same documented exception `notif_batch_flush_due()`,
  `notif_queue_batched()`, `seed_onboarding_progress()` and
  `post_new_member_on_join()` already carry, since `service_role` has no uid
  and the execute grant is what stands in for one.
- **Cadence: weekly**, resolved for COMM-303 alongside the clamp bounds. It
  matches the cadence this schema already runs its other periodic
  recomputations on — consistency streaks are a week-shaped question and
  `recap_weekly` is literally weekly — so the module has one periodic rhythm
  rather than three. **Now scheduled**: 202609050005 wired
  `cron.schedule('feed-weights-recompute', '17 4 * * 1', ...)` — Monday
  04:17 UTC, the exact cadence this section already named before a
  scheduler existed. Changing it is an edit to that one `cron.schedule`
  call; no schema depends on the literal string.

### relationship_score(p_viewer uuid, p_other uuid, p_as_of timestamptz default now()) returns numeric

- Shipped in 202608310002. COMM-301. **Internal, not a client call.**
- Purpose: how close `p_viewer` already is to `p_other`, as a 0..1 number.
  The one copy of the arithmetic `feed_page` used to hold inline.
- Params: `p_viewer` and `p_other` are member ids. `p_as_of` is the instant
  the 30-day interaction window is measured back from.
- Returns: `numeric` in `[0, 1]`, never null. Mutual follow 1.0, one-way
  follow 0.55, a reaction or comment by the viewer on the other member's
  posts inside the window adds 0.45, the sum capped at 1. A null viewer, a
  null other, or a member scored against themselves is 0.
- Auth: `security invoker`, **no grant to any role** — `public`, `anon` and
  `authenticated` are all revoked, the same shape
  `consistency_week_streaks()` has. It is called only from `security
  definer` functions that have already resolved and checked `auth.uid()`,
  and it borrows their rights to read `follows`, `reactions` and
  `post_comments` across members. A client reaching it directly gets 42501.
- Side effects: none, `stable`.
- Two things differ from this file's own forward reference, both so the
  extraction stays behaviour-preserving; neither changes a number:
  - **`p_as_of` is a third parameter**, defaulted, so the promised
    two-argument form `relationship_score(viewer, other)` still resolves
    verbatim. The inline version measured the window from `feed_page`'s
    frozen `v_anchor`, not from `now()`, and that is load-bearing: the
    anchor is what makes every page of one feed session score identically.
    A two-argument function reading `now()` internally would move the 30-day
    boundary between page 1 and page 2. `feed_page` passes `v_anchor`.
  - **The mutual-follow test is written out rather than delegated to
    `are_friends()`**, which resolves its viewer from `auth.uid()` and so
    cannot answer for an arbitrary `p_viewer`. The predicate is
    `are_friends()`'s body with `auth.uid()` replaced by `p_viewer`,
    self-exclusion and null guards included. `are_friends()` remains the one
    definition of "friends" every client-facing surface uses, and 0038
    asserts the two agree for every fixture member so the second copy cannot
    drift.
- Not used by `people_suggestions` (COMM-232), deliberately. That function
  answers "who should this member start following"; this one answers "how
  close is this pair already", which is close to its opposite. 0038 asserts
  `people_suggestions`' body does not mention it, so folding them together
  becomes a deliberate decision rather than a quiet one.

### classmate_day_counts(p_as_of timestamptz default now()) returns table(user_id uuid, shared_days integer)

- Shipped in 202608310003. COMM-302. **Internal, not a client call.**
- Purpose: how many calendar days inside a trailing 60-day window the caller
  and another member both have an `attendance_log` row for. The one copy of
  the recurring-classmate arithmetic, and the one copy of its privacy gate.
- Params: `p_as_of` is the instant the 60-day window is measured back from.
  **There is deliberately no viewer parameter** — the viewer is `auth.uid()`.
  `can_view_profile_field()` resolves *its* viewer from `auth.uid()` and
  cannot be told to answer for somebody else, so a `p_viewer` argument would
  be honoured by the overlap count and silently ignored by the privacy gate.
  That is the same trap COMM-301 refused when it declined to hand
  `are_friends()` a viewer it would ignore.
- Returns: one row per member with **at least one** shared day. A member with
  no overlap is absent, not a zero row; both callers read absent as 0. The
  caller themselves is never returned.
- The window is 60 days, stated once here, matching `people_suggestions`'
  two pre-existing time-stamped signals so all four of that function's
  signals are measured over the same period. Lower-bounded only, like
  `relationship_score()`'s 30-day window.
- Privacy: every returned member passes
  `can_view_profile_field(member, 'show_attendance')`, applied after the
  aggregate so it runs once per member who actually shares a day.
  `show_attendance` is attendance's own toggle, separate from
  `visible_to_club`, and it **defaults to false** — so out of the box no
  member contributes a classmate signal to anyone. A member with it off still
  accumulates `attendance_log` rows and those rows still count toward their
  own achievements (COMM-305) and their own leaderboard rank (COMM-306).
  Block edges in both directions and deleted profiles fall out through the
  same call; they are not re-implemented here. The helper's `is_admin()`
  short-circuit applies here too, so a real admin's feed and suggestion strip
  do see classmate signals from members who opted out — that is the
  module-wide behaviour of the one resolution point, the same way
  `feed_leaderboard`'s contract already records it, not a rule invented here.
- Auth: `security invoker`, **no grant to any role** — `public`, `anon` and
  `authenticated` are all revoked, the same shape `relationship_score()` and
  `consistency_week_streaks()` have. Called from `feed_page` and
  `people_suggestions` (both definer, both having already checked
  `auth.uid()`), it borrows their rights to read other members'
  `attendance_log` rows past `attendance_log_self_select`. A client reaching
  it directly gets 42501 — a member must not be able to ask who trains with
  whom, only to be ranked by it. The null-uid guard in the body returns an
  empty set rather than raising; it is a correctness guard, not an
  authorization one.
- Side effects: none, `stable`.
- Set-returning rather than scalar, and that is forced rather than stylistic:
  `people_suggestions` builds its candidate set *from* its signals union, so
  a member whose only overlap with the caller is attendance has to be
  introduced by this branch or they are never a candidate at all.
- Backed by `attendance_log_club_day_idx` (202608310001), created for exactly
  this read.

### attendance_classmates_today(p_limit int default 6) returns setof jsonb

- Shipped in 202608310005. COMM-307, closing COMM-P05. **Both halves are now
  in.** The client half landed in `cloud.js` in the same ticket: the
  trained-with-you card in COMM-115's feed top area, the follow action reusing
  `follow()` (COMM-230) and the `classmates_card_viewed` event. See "The
  client's side of this contract" at the end of this entry.
- Purpose: "who else trained today". Members other than the caller who have an
  `attendance_log` row for `current_date`, returned only when the caller has
  one too.
- Params: `p_limit`, clamped 1..20, null means 6. The forward reference named a
  zero-argument function; the parameter is defaulted, so that call form still
  resolves verbatim — the same accommodation COMM-301 made when it gave
  `relationship_score()` a defaulted `p_as_of`. 6 is a card-sized number for
  COMM-115's feed-top slot, where `people_suggestions`' 10 is a horizontally
  scrolling strip. The clamp range is the server's and is fixed; the default
  inside it is the client half's to revisit by passing an argument.
  **There is deliberately no viewer parameter**, the same refusal
  `classmate_day_counts()` documents and for the same reason: this function
  only ever answers for `auth.uid()`.
- Returns `setof jsonb`, one object per candidate, exactly four keys:
  `{user_id, display_name, handle, avatar_url}`. No date, no time, no count,
  no streak, no session detail — a caller learns that these members trained
  today and nothing about any other day. Those four keys are also exactly the
  header `community_profile` already returns to any member for any member.
- **"Today" means `occurred_on = current_date` on both sides of the self-join,
  and nothing else.** No window, no lookback, no count — that is the entire
  distinction from `classmate_day_counts()` (COMM-302), which answers "how
  often do these two train together" over 60 days. This function is written
  out rather than layered on that helper because reusing it would mean asking
  for a 60-day overlap and discarding 59 days of it, and would return members
  who trained beside the caller last week and not today. What *is* reused, to
  the letter, is the privacy gating. `current_date` is the server's UTC day,
  the same day `attendance_log`'s trigger compares against.
- The caller's own `current_date` row is the anchor: no row, no rows returned,
  which the join does on its own rather than by a separate check.
- Ordered most recently recorded first (`attendance_log.recorded_at`), then by
  display name falling back to handle, then by id — a total order, so the cut
  at `p_limit` is deterministic. Every member in the set trained today, so
  there is no signal to rank them by and the order is a choice: the card is a
  post-class moment, so the members who logged closest to the caller's own log
  are the likeliest to have been in the room, and in a club bigger than
  `p_limit` an alphabetical cut would show the same few members every day.
  `recorded_at` is when the row was written, not when the member trained —
  `attendance_log` records a day, not a time — which is why it is only the
  first key of a total order and not a claim the card makes.
- Privacy, per candidate: `can_view_profile_field(candidate,
  'show_attendance')`, the identical call `classmate_day_counts()` makes,
  applied after the candidate set is built for the identical reason. Block
  edges in both directions, deleted profiles and `visible_to_club` all fall
  out through that one call and are not re-implemented. `show_attendance`
  **defaults to false**, so out of the box this card is empty for everybody. A
  member with it off still logs attendance and it still counts toward their
  own achievements (COMM-305) and leaderboard rank (COMM-306). The `is_admin()`
  short-circuit applies to this gate as it does everywhere else.
- **Privacy, the caller's own toggle: enforced here, in the function.** A
  caller whose own `show_attendance` is off gets an **empty set** — the whole
  card, not a shorter one — which is COMM-307's "off means the card never
  renders for them, even though their own attendance is still logged and still
  counts elsewhere". It is not left to the client: every boundary in this
  module is enforced server-side rather than by a UI check, and this one is a
  reciprocity rule (every member on the card has opted into being seen
  training, so a member who declined that must not read the list).
  - It is a **direct `profiles.show_attendance` column read, not
    `can_view_profile_field(auth.uid(), 'show_attendance')`**, and that is
    load-bearing: the helper returns true for `p_target = auth.uid()` before
    it consults any toggle (the property `feed_leaderboard` relies on to keep
    a member on their own board), so asking it about the caller would always
    answer true and the gate would silently do nothing.
  - One consequence, stated rather than discovered: the direct read does not
    carry the `is_admin()` short-circuit, so an admin who never opted in gets
    an empty card like anybody else. The short-circuit exists so staff can see
    members' data, not to opt an admin into a reciprocal surface they
    declined. It still applies in full to the per-candidate gate.
  - **Empty, never a raise.** The card is already specified to render nothing
    at all when the member has not trained today or nobody else has
    (COMM-232's "on no signal, show nothing", which COMM-307 adopts by name),
    so the three ways to get no card — did not train, trained alone, opted
    out — are indistinguishable from outside and no client branch or error
    path is added.
- Self is excluded.
- No `allow_follows` filter and no `allow_follows` key, deliberately unlike
  `people_suggestions`: this is not a follow strip, it is "who trained today",
  and hiding a classmate who simply does not want followers would be wrong.
  The card's Follow control is the client's render decision, and the
  `follows_insert_self` policy (202608280003) enforces `allow_follows`
  server-side regardless.
- Auth: `security definer`, raises `not authorized` for a null `auth.uid()` or
  a caller with no `my_role_code()`, both checked before anything is read.
  `authenticated` may execute; `public` and `anon` are revoked. Definer crosses
  exactly one boundary, the one `people_suggestions` already documents:
  `attendance_log`'s policies are own-row plus staff (202608310001), so
  without elevation this could only ever return the caller's own row, which is
  the one row it excludes.
- Side effects: none, `stable`.
- Backed by `attendance_log_club_day_idx` (202608310001), which named this read
  when it was created.
- **The client's side of this contract** (`cloud.js`, COMM-307's client half):
  - One call per feed session, `p_limit: 6` passed explicitly rather than
    defaulted — the clamp is the server's, the number the card wants lives at
    the card. Issued from `afterRenderCommunity()` when the Feed sub-tab is on
    screen, on the same lazy pattern the consistency board and the directory
    use, **not** from `refreshSession()`'s boot batch: the member's own row for
    today is written by the `private_records` trigger behind `flushOutbox()`,
    which runs after that batch, so a boot-time call could ask before the row
    that anchors the join exists.
  - **Empty, failed and not-yet-answered all render nothing** — no heading, no
    empty state, no retry, no skeleton. `people_suggestions`' own error choice,
    and COMM-232's "on no signal, show nothing" for the empty case. The client
    does not try to tell the three server-side empties apart and has no
    client-side notion of "today" at all.
  - **The Follow control is rendered for every row**, unlike
    `memberRowHtml()`/`followListRowHtml()`, which guard on `allow_follows`.
    That is a direct consequence of the "no `allow_follows` key" decision two
    bullets up: there is nothing to guard on, `follows_insert_self` refuses the
    insert server-side, and `follow()` already surfaces a refused write the
    same way it does everywhere else. No pre-filter, so no other member's
    setting leaks into the card.
  - **No Message affordance**, per the phase's standing no-messaging
    resolution.
  - `classmates_card_viewed` (`rows`, `source`) fires once per load of the
    card, from the render hook rather than the fetch, and only when the card is
    on screen with rows on it. Not in `ACTIVE_MEMBER_EVENTS` — see
    `docs/community/metrics.md`.
  - Covered by `test/community-classmates-today.test.mjs`.

### feed_record_impressions(p_rows jsonb) returns void

- Shipped in 202608280006.
- Purpose: bulk insert feed_impressions for posts shown in one feed session.
- Params: `p_rows` is an array of {post_id, position, feed_session_id,
  shown_at}. Capped at 50. Rows missing post_id or feed_session_id are
  skipped rather than rejected.
- Auth: security definer, raises when auth.uid() is null. Every row is
  written with the caller's own user_id, never a value from the payload.
- Side effects: idempotent. A repeated batch collides on (user_id,
  feed_session_id, post_id) and does nothing.

### feed_record_interaction(p_post_id uuid, p_kind text, p_feed_session_id uuid) returns void

- Shipped in 202608280006 as `(p_post_id uuid, p_kind text)`. **Amended by
  202609060010**, which DROPPED that two-argument version and created this
  three-argument one. There is exactly one function by this name and there
  must stay exactly one — `create or replace` with a different argument list
  adds an overload rather than replacing, which is how a client RPC silently
  resolves to a stale body (see the three coexisting `add_post_comment`
  overloads). The migration ends with a `do` block that fails the apply if a
  second one ever appears.
- Purpose: record one feed interaction and flip `opened` or `engaged` on the
  single impression row from the session the interaction happened in.
- Params: `p_kind` one of open, react, comment, share, hide, save,
  profile_open. `p_feed_session_id` is the `feed_session_id` the client passed
  to `feed_record_impressions` for the session currently on screen.
- `p_feed_session_id` is REQUIRED — no default, deliberately. The bug
  202609060010 fixes was an over-broad scope, so a `default null` meaning
  "then stamp every session" would be the same bug with a friendlier name. A
  caller that omits the key fails PostgREST resolution (PGRST202 / 404), which
  is loud. A caller that supplies the key with a null VALUE still gets its
  `feed_interactions` row and simply flips no flag: raising there would roll
  the interaction insert back too, and the only caller is fire-and-forget, so
  that would lose strictly more data than the flag alone.
- Auth: security definer, own-row via auth.uid(). Rejects a post the caller
  cannot see. Rate limited at 300 per 10 minutes.
- Side effects: the UPDATE is scoped `user_id = auth.uid() and post_id =
  p_post_id and feed_session_id = p_feed_session_id`, which is the full unique
  key of `feed_impressions`, so it touches at most one row. Matching zero rows
  is a normal outcome, not an error — a post opened from a notification, a
  permalink, a profile or a search result was never shown in a feed session.
  feed_impressions has no UPDATE grant or policy, so this function is still
  the only thing that can flip those two flags.
- What it used to do, recorded because the data it produced is still in the
  table: the UPDATE was scoped by `(user_id, post_id)` only, so one open
  back-stamped `opened`/`engaged` onto every impression that member had ever
  recorded for that post, across all past sessions, and onto each future
  session's row the first time it was touched. The flags are monotonic, so it
  only ever accumulated. That erased the "shown and ignored" negative signal
  the personalised feed weights (202608310006) rank on and inflated the
  open/engagement rates the analytics dashboard (202609010006) divides.
  Historical rows are NOT backfilled: which row each flag belonged to is
  exactly the information the bug destroyed.

### leaderboard_row composite type

- Shipped in 202608290015. `(user_id uuid, display_name text, handle text,
  avatar_url text, rank integer, value numeric, is_self boolean)`, exactly the
  shape this file promised the feed cluster.
- A composite type rather than jsonb because a leaderboard is a table: every
  row has every column. `community_profile` is jsonb for the opposite reason,
  an absent key there means hidden.
- `chal_progress`'s `leaderboard` key still builds its own simpler
  `{user_id, name, handle, avatar_url, value}` objects (202608290003) and is
  deliberately untouched. Widening it to this type is an additive follow-up,
  not a break.

### feed_leaderboard(p_mode text, p_challenge_id uuid, p_scope text, p_limit int) returns setof leaderboard_row

- Shipped in 202608290015. COMM-210, COMM-211, COMM-212. Defaults are
  `p_challenge_id null`, `p_scope 'club'`, `p_limit 50`; `p_mode` has no
  default, so a typo cannot silently become the consistency board.
- Purpose: one ranked board for both modes and both scopes, with the caller's
  own standing always included.
- Params. `p_mode` is `consistency` or `progress`, `p_scope` is `club` or
  `friends`, both matched case-insensitively after trimming; anything else
  raises `unknown leaderboard mode %` or `unknown leaderboard scope %` naming
  the value. `p_limit` clamps to 1..100 (null means 50).
- `consistency` ranks club members by consecutive ISO weeks with a logged
  session, the same number `community_profile` returns as `current_streak`.
  `p_challenge_id` is ignored. The computation lives in
  `public.consistency_week_streaks()` (internal, no grants) so it exists once
  set-wide; `community_profile` keeps its own inline copy because merged
  migrations are not edited, and `0034_feed_leaderboard_and_suggestions_test`
  asserts the two agree on the same member (`0040` widens that to every member
  on the board at once). Since COMM-306 (202608310004) "a logged session" means
  an `attendance_log` day, not a posted workout; this signature, and everything
  else in this entry bar the privacy line below, did not move.
- `progress` ranks `challenge_participants.progress_value` for one challenge,
  participants with status `withdrawn` excluded. `p_challenge_id` is required:
  null raises `challenge required`, an unknown id raises `challenge not
  found`, and a draft challenge raises `challenge not found` for anyone but
  its creator or a `community.challenge.create` holder, so the board is not an
  existence oracle. In this mode the caller gets a row only if they are a
  participant; there is no standing in a challenge you did not enter, and that
  is the one case where the always-return-self rule cannot apply.
- `friends` restricts the ranked set to `are_friends()` (mutual follow) edges,
  always still including the caller.
- Every ranked member passes `can_view_profile_field(member,
  'in_leaderboards')` and `can_view_profile_field(member, 'visible_to_club')`,
  and in `consistency` mode `can_view_profile_field(member,
  'show_attendance')` as well (COMM-306, 202608310004 — the value being ranked
  is attendance-derived, and attendance carries its own toggle; on what that
  word does and does not mean, see 202609060024 below — it is the member's own
  logged training, never a class check-in). A member who fails any
  of the three is **absent from the ranked set, not ranked at 0**: on a board
  where 0 is a real value, publishing a 0 for an opted-out member would state
  something false about them rather than withhold something true. The
  `show_attendance` gate is not applied in `progress` mode, which ranks a
  challenge and has nothing to do with attendance. All three are self-exempt,
  so the always-return-self rule below is unaffected by any of them.
  Blocks are not re-implemented: that helper settles a block edge in either
  direction before it looks at any toggle. Its is_admin() short-circuit
  applies here too, so a real admin's board includes members who opted out;
  that is the module-wide behaviour of the resolution point, not a leaderboard
  rule.
- `rank` is a position, never shared and never gapped. Ties break by longer
  club tenure (`invite_redemptions.redeemed_at`, falling back to
  `profiles.created_at`), then alphabetically by display name (falling back to
  handle), then by id.
- Every eligible member is ranked, including a 0-week streak or 0 progress,
  because a rank is only real if the caller is inside the ranked set.
  COMM-210's "not enough data yet" empty state is therefore "no rows returned,
  or every returned `value` is 0", not "no rows returned".
- The caller's own row is always returned, appended last (after the top
  `p_limit` rows, in rank order) with its real rank when it falls outside the
  limit, so "where do I stand" is never a second round trip. COMM-212's "hide
  my result" is a client-only render choice on top of that row, not a
  parameter. The real, server-enforced opt-out is `in_leaderboards`, and it
  never hides the caller from themselves.
- Returns rows in board order, self last when appended. Club scope has no
  `club_id` filter, matching every other Phase 2 read function; the module is
  single-club today.
- Auth: security definer. Raises `not authorized` for a null `auth.uid()` and
  for a caller with no `my_role_code()`. Definer buys two things and no more:
  the caller's own row when their `visible_to_club` is off, and a streak count
  over posts the viewer cannot read one at a time (the same trade
  `community_streaks` already makes).
- Side effects: none.

### people_suggestions(p_limit int default 10) returns setof jsonb

- Shipped in 202608290015. COMM-232. Re-created in 202608310003 (COMM-302)
  with the **same signature** and an **additive** returned shape.
- Purpose: "אנשים שאולי תכירו" for the directory strip.
- Ranks candidates by, in priority order and lexicographically (one shared
  challenge outranks any number of shared training days, and any number of
  shared training days outranks any number of shared reactions):
  1. shared participation in a live challenge (`challenges.status = 'active'`
     and `end_at >= now()`);
  2. **shared training days** — calendar days both members have an
     `attendance_log` row for, from `classmate_day_counts()` (COMM-302);
  3. `feed_interactions` of kind `react` or `comment` on the same post by
     both members;
  4. `event_attendees` with response `going` on the same event by both.

  Ties break by display name (falling back to handle), then id. Position 2 is
  a product decision COMM-302 states rather than derives: recurring
  in-person overlap outranks a shared reaction or a shared "going" RSVP,
  because actually training beside someone repeatedly is a stronger reason to
  know them than tapping the same post once; it does not outrank a shared
  live challenge, which is a joint commitment with a deadline that both
  members opted into by name.
- The trailing 60-day window applies to three of the four signals
  (`feed_interactions.created_at`, `event_attendees.registered_at`, and
  `attendance_log.occurred_on` — the last stated inside
  `classmate_day_counts()`), on both sides of the pair. The challenge signal
  is bounded by the challenge being live instead, since an active challenge
  that started 90 days ago is current by definition.
- The classmate signal is additionally gated on
  `can_view_profile_field(candidate, 'show_attendance')`, inside
  `classmate_day_counts()` rather than here, so the gate cannot be applied
  differently in the two functions that use it. A candidate with attendance
  private is not merely ranked lower: they contribute no classmate signal at
  all, and if attendance was their only overlap with the caller they get no
  card. Their `attendance_log` rows still exist and still count for them.
- Excludes the caller, any follow edge in either direction, and anything
  `can_view_profile_field(candidate, 'visible_to_club')` or
  `can_view_profile_field(candidate, 'allow_follows')` rejects, which also
  settles block edges in both directions and deleted profiles. A candidate
  with no qualifying signal is not returned at all, so a brand new member gets
  a genuinely empty strip rather than a padded list.
- Returns `setof jsonb`, one object per candidate:
  `{user_id, display_name, handle, avatar_url, reason, signals}` where
  `reason` is the advisory label of the strongest signal (`challenge`,
  `classmate`, `interaction`, `event`) and `signals` is
  `{shared_challenges, shared_classmate_days, shared_interactions,
  shared_events}` integer counts. The ranking score itself is internal and
  not returned.
- **The COMM-302 change to this shape is additive only.**
  `shared_classmate_days` joined `signals`; `shared_challenges`,
  `shared_interactions` and `shared_events` keep their names and their
  meanings, so a client reading any of them needs no change. `reason` gained
  one possible value, `'classmate'`. That is exactly what 202608290015's own
  migration comment promised ("without renaming or removing a key any client
  is already reading"), and no client changed for COMM-302.
- `p_limit` clamps to 1..20 (null means 10).
- Auth: security definer, raises `not authorized` for a null `auth.uid()` or a
  caller with no `my_role_code()`. Definer crosses two boundaries on purpose:
  `feed_interactions` is self-select only, and `attendance_log`'s policies are
  own-row plus staff (202608310001), so no member could compute either kind of
  overlap otherwise. Only counts leave the function — never a post id, never
  an event id, never a date somebody trained.
- Side effects: none.
- COMM-307 (Phase 3) added a *different* attendance surface,
  `attendance_classmates_today()`: "who trained today", not "who to follow".
  **Shipped in 202608310005 and it did not change this function** — no
  signature, no key, no ordering here moved. Its contract is above.

### consistency_week_streaks() returns table(user_id uuid, streak integer)

- Shipped in 202608290015, re-created in 202608310004 (COMM-306) on the same
  signature. Internal, security invoker, **no grants at all** — not to `anon`,
  not to `authenticated`. `feed_leaderboard` is its only caller and it inherits
  that definer's rights, which is also how it reads every member's days past
  `attendance_log_self_select`.
- Purpose: the set-based form of `community_profile`'s `current_streak`, so
  the streak is computed once for every member instead of per member in a
  loop. Arithmetic: distinct ISO weeks carrying at least one
  `attendance_log.occurred_on` day, anchored on the member's latest such week,
  counted back while each week is exactly 7 days before the previous, and only
  when the anchor is the current week or the previous one. A week not trained
  does not break the streak while the anchor still qualifies.
- COMM-306 changed the source and nothing else: it read distinct ISO weeks
  carrying a POST_WORKOUT or POST_PR until 202608310004. That is the change
  this entry promised, made in the one place it promised to make it.
- A member with no `attendance_log` row is **absent from the returned set**,
  not a zero row. Every caller left-joins and coalesces, so zero-is-real is
  the caller's rule to keep, and both callers keep it.
- **Carries no privacy filter**, deliberately unlike `classmate_day_counts()`
  (202608310003), which folds `show_attendance` into itself. That helper's two
  callers both want an opted-out member to read as absent; this one's caller
  has to *exclude* the member from a ranked set instead, and a gate here would
  produce exactly the coalesced 0 COMM-306 rules out. `feed_leaderboard`
  applies `can_view_profile_field(member, 'show_attendance')` itself.
- Not a second definition of "streak": `0034` pins it to
  `community_profile`'s number for the caller and `0040` for every member on
  the board, so the two copies cannot drift.

### Leaderboard and suggestions client contract, COMM-210 to COMM-212, COMM-232

- One fetch path and one row renderer serve every board in the client. Rows are
  rendered in the order `feed_leaderboard` returned them and are never
  re-sorted, re-ranked or re-filtered; the printed position is the row's `rank`
  column, never an array index, because the caller's appended row's index is
  not its position.
- Three surfaces, two of them new:
  - Boards sub-tab, "טבלת עקביות": `consistency`, `p_limit 50`. Replaces the
    older `community_streaks` strip that used to sit there. `loadStreaks()` and
    `state.streaks` remain for the coach Welcome surface, which reuses the same
    per-member figure.
  - Challenge detail panel for `individual_performance` and `coach`:
    `progress`, `p_limit 20`, fetched inside `refreshChallengeView()` before the
    dialog drops its loading flag so the board and the detail land in one paint.
    This replaced the panel's earlier read of `chal_progress()`'s own
    `leaderboard` key. That key is unchanged and still shipped, per the
    `leaderboard_row` entry above; the client simply no longer reads it.
  - The same panel re-asking with `p_limit 50` is COMM-211's "dedicated full
    leaderboard screen": one code path and one set of states rather than a
    second surface.
- Empty states follow the contract's zero rule, not the row count: "no rows OR
  every `value` is 0". The friends-scope empty state is narrower still - the
  caller is always returned whatever the scope, so "no mutual follows yet" is
  "no row that is not mine", not "no rows".
- `p_scope` is the only thing the scope switch changes. A stale in-flight
  answer for the previous scope is dropped rather than painted.
- "Hide my result" is `state.hideMyLeaderboardResult`, a per-device
  localStorage flag (`haimunia-demo:hideMyLeaderboardResult`, default off,
  stored the same way `syncEnabled` is). It filters the caller's row out of the
  render and does nothing else: no request, no parameter, no write. It is
  deliberately worded in the UI so it cannot be mistaken for `in_leaderboards`,
  which is the real, server-enforced opt-out and stays in the Privacy panel.
- COMM-232's strip renders `people_suggestions(10)` in the order returned, with
  an advisory Hebrew label per `reason`. Follow reuses the same `follow()`
  insert-or-delete path the search UI's follow button uses; the card is dropped
  locally afterwards because the server already excludes a follow edge in
  either direction. On error the strip is omitted entirely - no heading, no
  empty state, no retry - which is deliberately unlike every other surface in
  this module.
- Two forward-looking markers, both `TODO(COMM-231)` in `cloud.js`: the
  suggestions strip is mounted on the Account sub-tab under COMM-228's search
  UI, and COMM-212's friends empty state routes to that same search, because
  the members directory does not exist yet. Both should point at the directory
  once it ships.

## Needs from schema, feed (Phase 2)

Nothing outstanding. `leaderboard_row`, `feed_leaderboard`,
`people_suggestions` and `consistency_week_streaks` all shipped in
202608290015; their contracts are the four entries directly above, under
"## Feed". COMM-210, COMM-211, COMM-212 and COMM-232 point at this heading and
should read those entries instead.

## Posts

### post_create(body text, visibility post_visibility, media jsonb, links jsonb) returns uuid

- Shipped in 202608280023. The client (COMM-102, COMM-103) calls it with all
  four params by name (`body`, `visibility`, `media`, `links`), so the
  signature has no defaults.
- Purpose: create a POST_TEXT or POST_PHOTO post with optional media and
  source links, one consistent write path.
- Params: `body` control chars stripped (tab and newline kept), trimmed, then
  capped at 1000. `visibility` a `post_visibility` label, defaulting to `club`
  when null. `media` up to 4 {storage_path, alt_text, decorative, position,
  width, height}; over 4 raises, an item with no `storage_path` raises.
  `decorative` is passed straight through to `post_media.decorative`
  (202608280022); the `post_media_normalize_alt` trigger owns the alt-text
  rule, so the function does not reconcile a decorative item that still
  carries alt text, and `position` defaults to the array index. `links`
  optional {workout_id, achievement_id, event_id}; the present keys are merged
  into `metadata` as top-level ids.
- `post_type` is `POST_PHOTO` only when there is media and no text, otherwise
  `POST_TEXT`, matching the client's optimistic rule.
- Returns: the new post id.
- Auth: security definer. Raises `not authorized` for a null caller or one
  without `community.post.create`, `recovery method required` when not
  `is_community_member()`, `posting_restricted` under an active restriction,
  `rate_limited` past 20 calls per 10 minutes under the `post_create` key.
  Empty body with no media raises.
- Side effects: one `workout_posts` row plus one `post_media` row per media
  item, in one transaction. `POST_CREATED` is emitted by the client after this
  returns (there is no server event bus), the same way `COMMENT_CREATED` and
  `REACTION_CREATED` are.

### post_set_visibility(post_id uuid, visibility post_visibility) returns void

- Shipped in 202609060007. It was documented here from Phase 1 and **never
  built**: cloud.js's own-post menu item ("שינוי נראוּת",
  `postApplyVisibility`) called it by this exact name and got PGRST202 every
  time, so the button had been dead since the day it shipped. Found by the
  launch-readiness audit.
- Argument names are `post_id` / `visibility`, unprefixed, because PostgREST
  resolves an RPC by argument name and those are the names the shipped client
  sends. Same shape as `post_delete(post_id uuid)` next to it.
- `visibility` is the `post_visibility` **enum**, exactly as `post_create`'s
  own parameter is, so the type is the validation and an unknown label is
  refused before the body runs. All five labels are accepted, including the
  legacy `public` and `followers` that pre-202608280004 rows still carry, so
  an author can move an old post without a migration.
- Auth: security definer, `auth.uid()` checked first, then **author only** —
  there is no moderator branch, deliberately: a moderator removes a post,
  they do not re-aim it.
- Raises (all P0001): `not authorized` for a null caller or a non-author,
  `visibility is required` for null, `post not found`,
  `post is no longer editable` for a deleted or non-active post, and
  `posting_restricted` when a COMM-153-restricted member tries to **widen**
  the audience. The audience ordering is `only_me` <
  `friends`/`followers` < `club`/`public`. Narrowing is always allowed,
  restricted or not — a member must be able to take their own content down.
  Setting the value it already has returns early and is never an error.
- Deliberately **not** gated on `is_community_member()`: re-aiming words
  already published is not a new community write, the same reasoning
  `comment_delete` and `toggle_reaction` give.
- Side effects: sets `workout_posts.visibility` and nothing else, which
  re-evaluates `posts_feed_select` for every viewer.

### post_edit_caption(post_id uuid, body text) returns void

- Shipped in 202609060007. Same history as `post_set_visibility` above —
  documented from Phase 1, never built, and cloud.js's "עריכת כיתוב" menu
  item (`postSaveCaption`) had been answering PGRST202 the whole time.
- Argument names are `post_id` / `body`, for the same PostgREST reason.
- Auth: security definer, `auth.uid()` checked first, then **author only**.
- Raises (all P0001): `not authorized` for a null caller or a non-author,
  `post not found`, `post is no longer editable` for a deleted or non-active
  post, `recovery method required` when not `is_community_member()`,
  `posting_restricted` under an active COMM-153 restriction, `rate_limited`
  past 30 calls per 10 minutes under the `post_edit_caption` key (the same
  budget `comment_edit` uses), and
  `a post needs text or at least one photo` when the normalised body is empty
  and the post carries neither a `post_media` row nor a legacy `photo_path`.
- An edit carries the same gates a create does, for the reason
  `comment_edit`'s own comment gives: rewriting an old post into new content
  is the obvious way around a posting restriction.
- Body normalisation is `post_create`'s, exactly — control characters
  `0x01-0x08` and `0x0B-0x1F` stripped (tab and newline kept, since the card
  renders `white-space: pre-wrap`), trimmed, capped at 1000, empty stored as
  NULL.
- Side effects: sets `workout_posts.body` and nothing else. There is no
  `edited_at` column on `workout_posts`; `updated_at` is stamped by the
  existing `workout_posts_touch` trigger, so an edit is still never silent.
- Neither function is the only write path. Unlike `post_comments`,
  `workout_posts` does carry an UPDATE grant and `posts_update_self` permits
  an author any column of their own row, so these are the **supported** path
  and the gates above are the rule it follows — not a boundary the way
  `comment_edit` is. Making them the only path would mean revoking UPDATE on
  `workout_posts`, which several shipped writes still need.

### post_delete(post_id uuid) returns void

- Shipped in 202608280025. The client's own-post menu (COMM-108) and
  `mod_review`'s `remove` decision both call it.
- Auth: security definer. The author always. A moderator when they hold
  `community.post.delete_any` OR `community.comment.moderate` OR real
  `is_admin`. The `community.comment.moderate` branch is wider than the
  original "author or `community.post.delete_any`" line, on purpose: every
  queue action routes through `mod_review`, so a coach who can see a reported
  post has to be able to remove it.
- Side effects: sets `deleted_at` and status `removed`. Idempotent on an
  already-removed post. A moderator removal writes one `content_delete`
  `admin_actions` row; an author removing their own post writes none.

### post_hide(post_id uuid) returns void

- Not a function. Superseded by a direct RLS write in 202608280014.
- Purpose: hide a post from the caller's feed only.
- Path: insert `{user_id: <self>, post_id}` into `hidden_posts`, delete the
  same row to unhide. Primary key `(user_id, post_id)` makes a repeat hide
  a conflict rather than a duplicate.
- Auth: own-row select, insert, and delete. Insert also requires
  `is_community_member()` and `post_visible_to_viewer(post_id)`, so a member
  cannot seed a row for a post they were never allowed to see and use it as
  an existence oracle. No update grant, since the only meaningful edit is
  deleting the row.
- Side effects: feed_page filters these out, COMM-110.

### post_save(post_id uuid) returns boolean

- Not a function. Superseded by a direct RLS write in 202608280014.
- Purpose: toggle a personal bookmark.
- Path: insert or delete a `saved_posts` row, same shape and same policy set
  as `hidden_posts`. The client owns the toggle, the table has no state
  beyond the row existing.

### pr_share(record_id text, note text default '', media jsonb default '[]'::jsonb, p_idempotency_key uuid default null) returns uuid

- Shipped in 202609060019 (five-persona UX audit, defect 1). Before that
  migration this function **did not exist in any migration**: it was
  documented here, fully wired in `cloud.js` (`sharePrPrompt()`), and
  answered PGRST202 "Could not find the function" on every call since the
  day the prompt shipped. Sharing a PR had never once worked.
- **`record_id` is `text`, not `uuid`, and this entry published the wrong
  type until 202609060019 landed.** The value the client sends is
  `entry.id` from the offline training log — `uid("set")` in
  `src/shared/safe-helpers.js`, i.e. the literal string
  `"set-" || crypto.randomUUID()`. A `uuid` parameter would fail to cast in
  PostgREST before the body ever ran, on every single call. `text` is also
  what `private_records.record_id` and `workout_posts.source_record_id`
  already are. Anyone who implemented the old line would have shipped a
  second outage on top of the one being fixed.
- Argument names are the shipped client's and are deliberately **not**
  `p_`-prefixed — PostgREST resolves an RPC by the exact set of named
  arguments in the request body, and the live call site is
  `rpc("pr_share", { record_id, note, media })`. Same reason `post_create`,
  `post_delete` and `community_profile` are unprefixed. Only the optional
  idempotency key carries the `p_` form, matching 202609060014.
- Purpose: create a POST_PR from a detected personal record.
- Auth: `security definer`, granted to `authenticated` only (`revoke ... from
  public, anon`). It writes `workout_posts` and `post_media` past
  `posts_insert_self` and `post_media_insert_author`, so it re-checks
  `post_create`'s gates by hand, in `post_create`'s order: `not authorized`
  (null caller), `recovery method required` (`is_community_member()`),
  `not authorized` (`has_perm('community.post.create')`),
  `posting_restricted` (COMM-153), then `rate_limited` past 20 per 10
  minutes. The rate limit uses **`post_create`'s own action key**, not a
  per-function one: a member's posting budget is one budget, and a separate
  key would hand a scripted client 20 posts plus 20 shares per window.
- Ownership, and the three cases it resolves server-side. The client sends
  an id and nothing else, so every figure on the card is read out of the
  caller's own `private_records` rows or not published at all.
  - The caller owns a live `strength_entry`/`wod_entry` row with this
    `record_id` (`deleted_at is null`). Normal path; all figures are
    recomputed from it.
  - The `record_id` belongs to a **different** member: refused,
    `not authorized`. Without this a member could attach their post to
    someone else's record and the card's "פתיחת האימון" deep link would
    point a reader at a record that is not the post's.
  - **Nobody at all holds the `record_id`: allowed, with no performance
    claim of any kind — note and photo only.** This is not a hole. Cloud
    backup is opt-**out** (`enableSyncIfAllowed`/`backupOptedOut`), so a
    member who turned sync off in Settings has a genuine PR on their device
    and no server copy of it, forever; refusing would make "share my PR"
    permanently and silently broken for them. It also covers the ordinary
    race where the share is tapped before `flushOutbox()` lands the row. An
    unclaimed id buys the caller nothing they could not get from
    `post_create` with free text.
- Metadata written, all recomputed here and none of it read from the
  request: `movement`, `new_result`, `previous_result`, `improvement`,
  `achieved_on` — the exact keys `renderPrPostCard` reads and the exact
  first four `feed_page` strips when the author has `show_workout_results`
  off (202608310006). `previous_result`/`improvement` come from the caller's
  own best prior weight for the **same movement at the same rep count**,
  excluding this record and anything logged after it, so "improvement is
  recomputed server-side from the record, not trusted from the client" is
  literal.
- **Known limitation, recorded rather than papered over: `movement`
  resolves only for a CUSTOM movement.** Only `customMovements` are ever
  synced to `private_records` (`queueAllLocalRecordsForSync`, app.js), so a
  PR on a built-in movement publishes its numbers with no movement name and
  `renderPrPostCard` falls back to `שיא אישי`. Closing it needs either the
  movement name in the call (a signature change plus a client-supplied
  display string) or a server-side catalogue of the built-in movements.
  Neither was smuggled into 202609060019.
- Validation: `record is required` for null, blank, or over 160 characters
  (`private_records.record_id`'s own CHECK, so a longer id cannot name a
  record in this database and is malformed rather than case three).
  `at most 4 photos per post`; `each media item needs a storage_path`;
  `a post needs text or at least one photo`, reachable only when there is no
  server copy of the record AND no note AND no photo. Body normalisation is
  `post_create`'s byte for byte — control characters stripped, trimmed,
  capped at 1000, empty stored as NULL.
- **Idempotent twice over.** The optional `p_idempotency_key`
  (202609060014's `idem_begin`/`idem_complete`, the same shape
  `post_create` takes, so the `cloud.js` owner can route the call through
  `communityRpc()`/`OUTBOX_ACTIONS` later with no signature change); and,
  with no key at all, the natural unique
  `workout_posts(author_id, source_type, source_record_id)`. A repeat share
  finds the record's existing **POST_PR**, returns its id and writes nothing,
  so a double tap on "שיתוף" or a retry after a dropped response converges on
  one post rather than raising 23505 the client would render as a failure.
  The already-POST_PR check runs ahead of the rate limit, so a double tap
  costs no budget, and it cannot overwrite the note that was published first.
- **RESOLVED in 202609060025 — the natural key collided with the legacy
  workout share, and `pr_share` reported a success it had not performed.**
  `publishWorkout()` (cloud.js) upserts `workout_posts` with
  `source_type = item.type` (`strength_entry`/`wod_entry`) and
  `source_record_id = item.id`, i.e. **the same `entry.id`** `pr_share` is
  keyed on, `on conflict author_id,source_type,source_record_id`. The unique
  constraint does not include `post_type`, so one logged record owns one slot.
  As shipped in 202609060019 the prior-post probe did not filter on
  `post_type` either: a member who had already shared that workout and then
  tapped "שיתוף" on the PR prompt got the POST_WORKOUT's id back, no POST_PR
  was created, the note and photo were discarded, and `sharePrPrompt()` still
  showed `השיא שותף לקהילה` and emitted `POST_CREATED` with
  `post_type: "POST_PR"` for a post that was not one. Four ordinary taps.
  - **The resolution: one record yields one post, and a prior POST_WORKOUT
    for that record is UPGRADED IN PLACE into the POST_PR.** `post_type`,
    `source_type`, `title`, `result_text`, `occurred_on`,
    `score_value`/`score_direction` (server-recomputed, replacing
    `publishWorkout`'s client-supplied score), `metadata` and `body` are set;
    `deleted_at` is cleared; supplied media replaces the card's `post_media`.
    `sharePrPrompt()`'s existing message and event become true with **no
    client change**.
  - The other two candidates were rejected. Adding `post_type` to the unique
    constraint means dropping the three-column one, which is
    `publishWorkout()`'s `on conflict` arbiter — Postgres would raise 42P10
    on that upsert and break the legacy workout share for every member the
    moment the migration deployed. A distinct `source_type` for a PR share is
    landable alone but still ships two cards for one logged set, and it
    destroys what `source_type` is for on these rows: the card's
    "פתיחת האימון" deep link emits
    `data-source-type="${m.source_type || post.source_type || "workout"}"`,
    so a literal `pr` would reach the client's open-source handler as a value
    it has never seen.
  - Two cards for one set is also the wrong product answer, and this feed's
    own ranking amplifies it rather than absorbing it: `feed_page` classes
    `POST_WORKOUT` as diversity class `workout` and `POST_PR` as `boost`, and
    the diversity pass explicitly **prefers** a boost card once a workout run
    reaches its threshold — so two near-identical cards from one member about
    one set are actively steered adjacent. The repetition penalty (−6 per
    extra post by one author inside 24h, capped at −18) does not undo that; it
    just also penalises the member's genuinely separate posts that day.
  - **No constraint or index changed, so there is no migration cost on
    existing rows**: nothing is dropped, nothing is rebuilt, no row is
    rewritten, and `publishWorkout`'s on-conflict target keeps its arbiter.
- **What the upgrade deliberately does not move.** `visibility` — promoting an
  already-published `followers` post to `club` would widen its audience
  without the member asking (an `identity-privacy` boundary; the upgraded post
  keeps the visibility it was published with, the same principle `ach_share`
  applies by inheriting the achievement's). `published_at` — `pr_share` is
  reachable directly over PostgREST for any of the caller's own record ids, so
  bumping it would let a member re-float an arbitrarily old post to the top of
  every feed. `comparison_key` — the leaderboard key belongs to the workout
  share that computed it. Reactions and comments survive the upgrade: it is
  still the card for that set.
- A prior post whose `status` is `hidden` or `removed` is **refused** with
  `post is not available` rather than revived — a moderator acted on that
  card, and re-publishing the same content under a new `post_type` would be
  moderation evasion. A merely soft-deleted prior post **is** revived, because
  the member is at that moment explicitly asking to publish the record. A
  prior post that is neither `POST_WORKOUT` nor `POST_PR` raises
  `this record already has a post`; it is unreachable from any shipped writer
  (`post_create` never sets `source_record_id`) and refusing loudly beats
  rewriting a row of unknown shape.
- The upgrade's `UPDATE` runs inside the transaction-local
  `app.allow_moderation_write` pin, because `deleted_at`, `score_value` and
  `score_direction` are guarded by `workout_posts_guard_moderated_fields`
  (202609060011). Same mechanism `post_delete()`,
  `request_account_deletion()` and `admin_remove_member()` already use; set
  and cleared around that one statement.
- Side effects: one `workout_posts` row created **or one upgraded** (`POST_PR`;
  visibility `club` on the insert path, preserved on the upgrade path;
  `source_type` the record's own type, `source_record_id` the text id), up
  to 4 `post_media` rows (replacing any existing set when media is supplied),
  one `post_create` rate-limit token. The post-type privilege guard
  (202609060004) needs nothing added and is not weakened: `POST_PR` is outside
  its four staff-only labels, and this function takes no `post_type` from the
  caller at all. Returns the post id, which is now always the id of a
  `POST_PR`.

### community_profile(user_id uuid) returns jsonb

- Shipped in 202608280022. A function, not a view: it has to answer per
  caller. The argument is named `user_id`, not `p_user_id`, because
  PostgREST matches RPC arguments by name and the client already calls
  `rpc("community_profile", { user_id })`.
- Purpose: the profile community section in one call, with each field
  filtered by `can_view_profile_field` against the caller.
- Auth: security definer, raises `not authorized` when `auth.uid()` is null
  and when a block edge sits in either direction, raises `profile not found`
  for a deleted or unknown target. Definer buys exactly one thing: a target
  with `visible_to_club` off is not selectable through
  `profiles_read_authenticated`, and the contract still says a fully private
  member returns name, role, and member since.
- Returns one jsonb object. Every key past the header is optional and an
  absent key means the field is hidden, so the client omits it rather than
  rendering a blank.
- Always present: `id`, `display_name`, `handle`, `avatar_url`, `role`,
  `member_since`, `allow_follows`. `role` and `member_since` come from the
  first `invite_redemptions` row, falling back to `profiles.created_at`.
  `allow_follows` is false on your own profile so the overlay does not offer
  a Follow button pointed at yourself. `first_name` and `last_name` stay in
  the client contract but are never returned: `profiles` has no such
  columns, and the client already falls back to `display_name` then
  `handle`.
- Present only when `visible_to_club` passes: `follower_count`,
  `following_count`, `active_challenge` (`{id, title, ends_at}`, omitted
  when there is none), `posts`.
- Present only when `show_workout_results` passes: `training_frequency` (a
  display string, sessions per week over the last 28 days, omitted at zero)
  and `recent_workouts` (`[{title, date}]`, up to 5). Both read
  `workout_posts` directly and answer "what did this member choose to share",
  which is why COMM-306 left them exactly as they were.
- Present only when `show_workout_results` **and** `show_attendance` both
  pass: `current_streak` (consecutive ISO weeks with an `attendance_log` day,
  the same number `consistency_week_streaks()` computes set-wide; a week not
  yet trained does not break it; 0 for a member with no attendance days,
  never an error). Since 202608310004, COMM-306. The second toggle is the one
  addition that ticket's own outline did not name: the number is now derived
  from attendance, so it may not travel past attendance's own toggle — the
  rule 202608310001 wrote down for every member-facing Phase 3 reader. It also
  keeps this function and `feed_leaderboard` saying the same thing about the
  same member, since an opted-out member is absent from the board. Absent key
  means hidden, as everywhere else here, and the client already renders it as
  no row rather than a blank.
- Present only when `show_prs` passes: `prs` (`[{movement, result,
  achieved_on}]`, up to 20). A missing key hides the Progress tab, an empty
  array shows the no-PRs state.
- Present only when `show_achievements` passes: `achievements`
  (`[{title, badge_icon, code, unlocked_at}]`, up to 24) and
  `recent_achievement` (`{title, badge_icon}`, omitted when the list is
  empty). The per-unlock `visibility` column is applied on top of the
  toggle, the same three-way rule `member_achievements_read` spells out.
- `posts` is up to 10 card-contract rows for the target, each still passing
  `post_visible_to_viewer`, so an only_me or friends post never reaches a
  viewer the author did not choose. `result_text` and the numeric
  `metadata` keys are stripped when `show_workout_results` is off, the same
  way `feed_page` strips them.
- Every number here except `current_streak` is derived from posts the member
  published. A member who trains and never posts reads as zero in those. Since
  COMM-306 (202608310004) `current_streak` is the exception and comes from
  `attendance_log` — the member's own logged training, not a class check-in
  (202609060024) — so the reverse also holds: a member who trains and never
  posts has a real streak and no `training_frequency`.

## Client card contract (renderPostCard)

`window.renderPostCard(post)` is owned by posts (COMM-101) and consumed by
feed (COMM-110) and engagement (COMM-120 to 125). It returns an HTML string
for one feed card and never throws. `window.renderPostCardSkeleton()` returns
the loading placeholder.

Each `post` row the feed passes in carries:

- `id` text, `post_type` one of the twelve labels, `author_id` uuid or null
  for authorless system, new member, announcement and coach club posts.
- `author` `{display_name, handle, avatar_url}` when known. The legacy flat
  `display_name` and `handle` on the row are read as a fallback.
- `created_at` or `published_at` for the timestamp. `body` the caption or
  text, capped at 1000 on render. `visibility` one of club, friends,
  only_me, with public and followers read as legacy aliases.
- `media` `[{url | storage_path, alt_text, decorative, position, width,
  height}]`, up to 4. A `storage_path` with no `url` is resolved through the
  existing signed-url cache.
- `reaction_count` and `comment_count` integers. `reaction_count` falls back
  to the legacy `cheer_count`.
- `metadata` a per-type object. POST_WORKOUT: `workout_name`, `workout_date`,
  `result_text`, `score_type`, `effort` (rx, scaled, level), `level`,
  `is_pr`, `source_type`, `source_id`. POST_PR: `movement`, `new_result`,
  `previous_result`, `improvement`, `achieved_on`. POST_ACHIEVEMENT:
  `title`, `badge_icon`, `earned_on`, `explanation`. POST_CHALLENGE:
  `challenge_title`, `challenge_id`. POST_EVENT: `event_title`, `event_id`,
  `starts_at`. POST_ANNOUNCEMENT: `title`. POST_NEW_MEMBER: `member_id`,
  `member_name`, `joined_on`. POST_ATTENDANCE_MILESTONE: `milestone_label`,
  `count`, plus `member_id` (produced since 202608310007, COMM-305; the
  renderer reads only the first two, `member_id` is what the producer's own
  "already posted" guard matches on).

Markup feed and engagement can rely on:

- Root is `<article class="chart-card post-card" data-post-type="..."
  data-post-id="...">`. An unknown type adds `data-post-unknown="1"` and a
  failed render is `<article class="chart-card post-card"
  data-post-error="1">`.
- The engagement bar is `<div class="chip-row post-actions">` with
  `data-community-action="cheer"` and `data-community-action="toggle-comments"`
  each carrying `data-id="<post id>"`. POST_SYSTEM omits the bar entirely.
- The comment thread slot is the existing `renderComments(post)` output,
  appended inside the article, keyed on `state.openComments[post.id]`.
- The action menu trigger is `data-community-action="toggle-post-menu"` in the
  card head. Own post items: `post-edit-caption`, `post-change-visibility`,
  `post-delete`. Other: `post-save`, `post-hide`, `report`, `block`. `report`
  and `post-*` carry the post id, `block` carries the author id.
- `post_hide` and `post_save` are direct RLS writes to `hidden_posts` and
  `saved_posts` with the row shape `{user_id, post_id}`, toggled by presence.

## Achievements

### ach_evaluate(user_id uuid, trigger text, payload jsonb) returns setof text

- Purpose: return achievement codes newly unlocked by an event.
- Triggers handled: WORKOUT_COMPLETED, PR_CREATED, MEMBER_JOINED,
  COMMENT_CREATED, REACTION_CREATED, CHALLENGE_COMPLETED. ATTENDANCE_RECORDED
  is accepted and is a no-op until COMM-P03.
- Auth: service role only, called by event-bus consumers.
- Side effects: inserts member_achievements once per non-repeatable
  definition, emits ACHIEVEMENT_UNLOCKED. Idempotent on repeat.

### ach_share(member_achievement_id uuid, caption text default '', media jsonb default '[]'::jsonb, p_idempotency_key uuid default null) returns uuid

- Shipped in 202609060019 (five-persona UX audit, defect 1), alongside
  `pr_share` and for the same reason: it was documented here and wired in
  `cloud.js` (`shareAchievementUnlock()`) but had no definition in any
  migration, so it answered PGRST202 on every call. The published signature
  was **correct** — argument names and the `uuid` first parameter are the
  shipped client's — and was implemented as documented; only the parameter
  defaults and the idempotency key are new.
- Purpose: create a POST_ACHIEVEMENT for one of the caller's own
  `member_achievements` rows and set `shared_at`.
- Auth: `security definer`, granted to `authenticated` only. The same gate
  ladder as `pr_share`, in the same order, sharing the same `post_create`
  rate-limit key. Ownership is one predicate: the row is read from
  `member_achievements` and refused with `not authorized` when its `user_id`
  is not the caller — **not** `achievement not found`, which would be a lie
  to the one member whose achievement it is not.
- Raises: `achievement is required`, `achievement not found` (unknown row, or
  a definition since deleted), `a private achievement cannot be shared`
  (`visibility = 'only_me'`), `at most 4 photos per post`, `each media item
  needs a storage_path`. The client already refuses `only_me` before
  calling, which is exactly why the server has to as well.
- The post **inherits the achievement's own visibility** (`club` or
  `friends`), never a hardcoded `club`, so a friends-only decoration does not
  become a club-wide post by being shared.
- Title, `result_text` and metadata (`achievement_id`, `code`, `title`,
  `badge_icon`, `explanation`, `earned_on` — the keys
  `renderAchievementPostCard` reads) come from `achievement_definitions`,
  never from the request. Only the caption and the media are read from the
  caller.
- Idempotent twice over, exactly as `pr_share` is: the optional
  `p_idempotency_key`, and the natural unique
  `workout_posts(author_id, source_type, source_record_id)` with
  `source_type = 'achievement'` and the member-achievement id as text. A
  repeat share returns the first post's id, writes no second post, and does
  **not** rewrite an existing `shared_at` — `shared_at` is stamped only when
  it was null, so a re-share does not overwrite the date it was first
  shared.
- **Sibling risk checked and cleared while resolving `pr_share`'s collision
  (202609060025), because the two paths share one unique slot and nobody had
  verified it.** `publishAchievement()` (cloud.js) writes the same
  `source_type = 'achievement'` with `source_record_id = achievementId`, where
  `achievementId` is app.js's own local badge id. Those ids are slugs —
  `capstone`, `well-rounded`, `pr-<category>-<tier>`, `streak-<tier>`,
  `sessions-<n>`, `tenure-<id>`, `rx-<wodId>` — while `ach_share` writes
  `member_achievements.id::text`, a column typed `uuid` with a
  `gen_random_uuid()` default. **No slug is uuid-shaped, so the two id spaces
  are disjoint and cannot collide**; asserted in
  `supabase/tests/0087_pr_share_workout_collision_test.sql`. The server
  `achievement_definitions.code` namespace is separate again
  (`sessions_10`, `well_rounded` — underscores, and never written into
  `source_record_id` by either path).
  - What remains is **duplicate content, not a false success**: a member can
    share the same milestone from the app.js celebration sheet and from the
    community unlock sheet and get two `POST_ACHIEVEMENT` cards. Both writes
    genuinely land, each returns a real post, and neither reports something it
    did not do — so this is not `pr_share`'s defect class and it is recorded
    here rather than silently "fixed" by a migration. Collapsing the two is a
    client-side question about which sheet should offer the share at all.
- Side effects: one `workout_posts` row, up to 4 `post_media` rows,
  `member_achievements.shared_at`, one `post_create` rate-limit token.
  Returns the post id.

### ach_claim(p_codes text[]) returns setof ach_claim_row

- Shipped in 202608280020, with the composite type
  `public.ach_claim_row(code text, member_achievement_id uuid, visibility
  text)`. Execute granted to `authenticated`.
- Purpose: record client-detected non-attendance milestones for the calling
  member. The offline app already computes session counts, summed PR counts,
  week streaks, first Rx, and membership tenure from data on the device. The
  browser cannot call `ach_evaluate` (service role only) and never emits a
  server event for a privately logged lift, so this is how those crossings
  reach `member_achievements`.
- Params: `p_codes` up to 50 `achievement_definitions.code` values. A null or
  empty array is a no-op that returns nothing. Over 50 raises.
- Returns: one `ach_claim_row(code text, member_achievement_id uuid,
  visibility text)` per row this call newly wrote, so the client celebrates
  only genuine new unlocks and stays silent on replay. A code that was
  already held (non-repeatable) or that did not qualify is simply absent from
  the result, never an error.
- Auth: security definer. Raises when `auth.uid()` is null. Requires
  `is_community_member()`. Every row is written with the caller's own
  `user_id`, never a value from the payload. Rate limited at 30 calls per 10
  minutes under the `ach_claim` action key, which raises `rate_limited`. The
  limit exists because a repeatable client-claimable definition would
  otherwise be an unbounded insert loop.
- Accepts a code only when its definition is `enabled`, its `trigger_type` is
  not `ATTENDANCE_RECORDED`, and its `config->>'client_claimable'` is
  `'true'`. Every other code in the array is ignored, not rejected. This is
  what keeps `community` and `challenge` unlocks, and most `club` unlocks,
  which are gameable from the client, on the `ach_evaluate` event-bus path
  where the server owns the count.
- Tenure verification (202608290002): the four club-category
  `anniversary_year_*` rows are the one exception, seeded
  `client_claimable: true` and `config->>'metric' = 'tenure_days'` because,
  unlike session count, PR count, week streak, or Rx count, membership
  tenure is not something only the device can see — it is a pure function of
  `public.invite_redemptions.redeemed_at`, a server-set timestamp
  (`default now()` at redemption, never client-writable). For any accepted
  code whose `config->>'metric' = 'tenure_days'`, `ach_claim` independently
  requires `invite_redemptions.redeemed_at <= now() - (threshold || '
  days')::interval` for the calling user before it is accepted; a claim
  short of the threshold is silently absent from the result, same as any
  other refused code, never an error. The boundary is inclusive: a
  redemption exactly `threshold` days old already qualifies. This check is
  keyed on `config->>'metric'`, not on the code, so any future
  `tenure_days`-metered definition is covered automatically with no further
  migration. Every other `client_claimable` metric is unaffected — the added
  condition is an `or` that short-circuits true when `metric` is not
  `'tenure_days'`.
- Side effects: inserts one `member_achievements` row per accepted, newly
  qualifying code, copying `visibility` from the definition. The partial
  unique index `member_achievements_once_idx` enforces once-per-non-repeatable
  under concurrency, so a lost race is swallowed, not surfaced. A repeatable
  definition writes a fresh row each call. Idempotent for non-repeatable
  codes.
- It does not emit `ACHIEVEMENT_UNLOCKED` itself. Both unlock paths write one
  `member_achievements` row, so the single place that sees every unlock is an
  AFTER INSERT trigger on that table. See "Needs from schema, achievements".

### achievement_definitions seed

- Shipped in 202608280020. The 27 non-attendance rows from
  `docs/community/achievement-seed.md`, inserted as `on conflict (code) do
  update` so a re-run converges. Every client-claimable row carries `config`
  key `client_claimable: true`. The four attendance rows from 202608280007
  are not repeated and stayed `enabled = false` until COMM-P03. **They are
  `enabled = true` since 202608310007 (COMM-305), which gave them a
  producer.** None of the four carries a `client_claimable` key and
  `ach_claim` refuses them on `trigger_type` regardless — enabling them
  widened nothing on the claim path.

## Needs from schema, achievements

Functions the achievements cluster (COMM-130 to COMM-134) relies on and that
schema still owns. No migration is written here.

- `ach_evaluate(user_id uuid, trigger text, payload jsonb)`, the service-role
  event-bus path. **Still not built**, and COMM-305 did not build it either:
  the four `ATTENDANCE_RECORDED` codes are evaluated by a direct table
  trigger instead (see "Needs from schema, attendance achievements" below),
  the same precedent `challenge_progress_apply` set for cooperative
  challenges. Everything community, challenge, and club shaped in the seed is
  `client_claimable: false` and unlocks only through `ach_evaluate`, so those
  rows still cannot be earned at all until it lands. Attendance is now the
  only trigger type with a real server-side producer.
- The `ACHIEVEMENT_UNLOCKED` consumer is an AFTER INSERT trigger on
  `public.member_achievements`, not a per-function emit. That way `ach_claim`
  and `ach_evaluate` produce one shape and neither can forget to fire. It
  needs `notif_create`, which notifications still owns, so it lands with that
  function. See "Needs from schema, notifications". **Confirmed live for
  attendance unlocks by COMM-305**: `member_achievements_notify`
  (202608280027) is `after insert ... for each row` with no `WHEN` clause and
  no filter on how the row got there, so an attendance-sourced unlock
  notifies exactly like a claimed one and COMM-305 wrote no notification code
  at all. Asserted, not assumed, in
  `supabase/tests/0043_attendance_achievements_test.sql`.

## Challenges

Landed by schema in 202608290003 through 202608290006, closing "Needs from
schema, challenges" below for COMM-201 to COMM-208. `challenges`,
`challenge_teams`, `challenge_participants`, and `challenge_progress`
themselves, and their direct-RLS create/edit/join/leave paths, still date to
202608280009 (COMM-006) - nothing here changes that grant shape. What
follows is the read shape and the write paths RLS could not express as a
plain own-row policy.

### challenge_progress_view composite type

Shipped in 202608290003. `(challenge_id uuid, challenge_type text, title
text, ends_at timestamptz, my_progress numeric, my_status text, target_value
numeric, participant_count integer, club_total numeric, team_totals jsonb,
leaderboard jsonb)`. A field that does not apply to the challenge's type is
null, never zeroed, so the client can tell "not applicable" from "genuinely
zero" (an empty cooperative pool is `club_total = 0`; a non-cooperative
challenge is `club_total = null`).

- `club_total` populated only for `cooperative`: the sum of every
  `challenge_progress.delta` row on the challenge, not `challenge_participants
  .progress_value`, so a departed member's earlier contributions stay in the
  aggregate (COMM-203).
- `team_totals` populated only for `team`: `[{team_id, name, total}]`, one
  entry per `challenge_teams` row, `total` summed from
  `challenge_progress.delta` grouped by `challenge_progress.team_id` - see
  the new column below, not from the live `challenge_participants.team_id`,
  for the same "a departed member's history should not vanish" reason
  COMM-204 states explicitly for team totals. Sorted by team name.
- `leaderboard` populated only for `individual_performance` and `coach`: top
  20 `challenge_participants` by `progress_value` descending, each entry
  filtered by `can_view_profile_field(member, 'in_leaderboards')` and a block
  edge in either direction with the caller, same privacy predicate the
  Phase 2 feed leaderboard is specified to use. Shape assumption, flagged
  because `feed_leaderboard` (COMM-210/211/212) is not built yet at the time
  this landed, still listed under "Needs from schema, feed (Phase 2)": each
  element is `{user_id, name, handle, avatar_url, value}` rather than
  `feed_leaderboard`'s richer `leaderboard_row` (which also carries `rank`
  and `is_self`). `name` falls back display_name -> handle, same as the feed
  card contract. If/when `feed_leaderboard` lands this can widen to match it
  without breaking a client reading the fields already here.
- `my_progress` / `my_status` are null, not zero/`'active'`, when the caller
  has no `challenge_participants` row for this challenge - a non-participant
  can still read every other field.
- `participant_count` counts `challenge_participants` rows with
  `status <> 'withdrawn'`.

### chal_progress(challenge_id uuid) returns challenge_progress_view

- Shipped in 202608290003. The documented-but-never-built Phase 1 stub, now
  real.
- Purpose: personal, team, and club progress for one challenge, one shape
  for every `challenge_type`, so COMM-207's detail view calls one function
  regardless of type.
- Auth: security definer, raises `not authorized` for a null caller and for
  a caller with no live role (`my_role_code() is null`) - this is the
  "club member" gate, deliberately looser than `is_community_member()`
  because this is a read and read paths are not gated behind the recovery
  write requirement. A `draft` challenge raises `challenge not found` for
  anyone but its creator or a `community.challenge.create` holder, matching
  `challenges_read`.
- Side effects: none.

### challenge_progress new columns (202608290003, 202608290005)

- `team_id uuid references challenge_teams(id) on delete set null`: snapshot
  of the contributor's `challenge_participants.team_id` at insert time,
  written by a BEFORE INSERT trigger (`challenge_progress_stamp_team`), not
  by the client. `challenge_progress` had no team_id of its own and
  `challenge_participants` rows are deleted on leave (COMM-006's existing
  leave policy), so without a snapshot a departed member's historical
  contributions would have no team to be attributed to once their
  participant row was gone. Once stamped it never changes, even if the
  member later switches teams while still active - append-only, same as
  every other column on this table.
- `note text`, capped at 500 chars, and `entered_by uuid references
  profiles(id) on delete set null`: COMM-206's coach entry form attaches a
  short note to a logged delta, and needs to say who logged it (the coach)
  separately from who it is for (`user_id`, the participant). A self-insert
  under `challenge_progress_insert_self` must leave `entered_by` null - that
  policy (drop-and-recreate of the 202608280009 one) now checks
  `entered_by is null` in addition to its original three predicates, so only
  `chal_record_progress` (below), which runs past this policy entirely, can
  ever set it. Without that check a self-insert could otherwise forge
  `entered_by` to any uuid and the column would stop reliably meaning
  "a coach logged this on my behalf."

### challenge_progress_apply trigger (AFTER INSERT on challenge_progress)

- Shipped in 202608290004.
- Purpose: the client's insert grant on `challenge_progress` (COMM-006) is
  append-only and never touches `challenge_participants.progress_value` -
  the running total is server-derived, not client-summed. This trigger adds
  `NEW.delta` to the matching participant row's `progress_value` and, for
  `individual_target` and `individual_performance` challenges only, flips
  `status` to `completed` and stamps `completed_at` the first time the new
  total reaches `target_value`. It never lowers a completed status back to
  active on a later negative correction: the flip only ever fires from a
  not-yet-completed row, so once set, status is left exactly as it was on
  every later insert, matching the append-only "correct with a compensating
  delta" model 202608280009 already documents for the table. `consistency`
  and `team` are not in the auto-complete list - COMM-205's week-tracking
  and COMM-204's per-team totals do not ask for it, and my_status there stays
  whatever the participant row already carries.
- Auth: security definer (bypasses `challenge_participants_update_self` and
  `posts_insert_self`, both on purpose - see the milestone post below).
- Side effects, cooperative only: recomputes `club_total`
  (`sum(challenge_progress.delta)` for the challenge) and, for each of
  25/50/75/100 whose percentage of `target_value` the new total newly
  reaches, posts one authorless milestone update the first time - see next.
  A single contribution that jumps past more than one threshold at once
  (for example 20% -> 80%) posts once for every newly-crossed threshold in
  that same transaction, not just the highest. A `select ... for update` on
  the `challenges` row at the top of the trigger serializes concurrent
  progress inserts on the same challenge, so two contributions landing at
  the same instant cannot both decide "not posted yet" and double-post.
- Cooperative milestone post, authorless-post pattern: no dedicated insert
  site for `POST_SYSTEM` or `POST_NEW_MEMBER` exists anywhere in the
  migration history to copy - grepping for both turns up only the enum
  labels and the 202608280004 comment saying `workout_posts.author_id` is
  nullable "for the authorless POST_SYSTEM and POST_NEW_MEMBER rows
  COMM-107 renders." COMM-107 was never built as a server insert. The
  nearest real precedent is `post_create` (202608280023): SECURITY DEFINER,
  inserting into `workout_posts` directly past `posts_insert_self` because
  that policy requires `author_id = auth.uid()` and a server-authored row
  has none. This trigger follows the same shape - SECURITY DEFINER, direct
  insert, `author_id = null`, `post_type = 'POST_CHALLENGE'` (already in the
  enum since 202608280004, no add-value-then-use split needed). "Already
  posted this threshold" is answered by querying `workout_posts` itself (a
  `POST_CHALLENGE` row already carrying that `challenge_id` and that
  `milestone` in its `metadata`) rather than a second piece of state that
  could drift from what was actually posted. `metadata` carries
  `challenge_id` and `challenge_title` (the two keys the POST_CHALLENGE
  client card contract already names) plus `milestone`, `club_total`, and
  `target_value`.

### chal_record_progress(p_challenge_id uuid, p_user_id uuid, p_delta numeric, p_note text) returns uuid

- Shipped in 202608290005.
- Purpose: the coach-entry path for a `coach` challenge type (COMM-206) -
  the only write path for progress a member did not log on their own.
  `challenge_progress_insert_self` only ever allows `user_id = auth.uid()`,
  so this is a security definer function, the same reasoning
  `add_post_comment` uses over a plain own-row policy.
- Auth: security definer. Raises `not authorized` for a null caller or one
  without `community.challenge.create`, `challenge and target participant
  are required` for a null id, `delta is required` for a null delta,
  `not an active participant` when `p_user_id` has no `challenge_participants`
  row on `p_challenge_id` with `status = 'active'`. No `check_rate_limit`
  call - matches the other permission-gated staff functions in this history
  (`pin_set`, `mod_restrict_member`, `mod_review`), none of which rate-limit
  on top of their permission check, and `challenge_progress_insert_self`
  itself has never been rate limited either.
- Side effects: one `challenge_progress` row, `source_type = 'coach_entry'`,
  `note` trimmed and capped at 500 chars (empty string stored as null),
  `entered_by` the calling coach. `challenge_progress_apply` and
  `challenge_progress_stamp_team` both still fire on this insert exactly as
  they do on a self-insert.

### challenges.ending_soon_notified_at timestamptz + chal_notify_ending_soon() returns integer

- Shipped in 202608290006.
- Purpose: `challenge_ending_soon`, sent once per challenge (not once per
  participant) to every joined active participant.
- Auth: security definer, same shape as `notif_batch_flush_due`: **grant
  execute to `service_role` only**, revoked from public, anon, and
  authenticated.
- Selects `challenges` where `status = 'active'`, `ending_soon_notified_at`
  is null, and `end_at` is between now and 48 hours from now. For each,
  calls `notif_create(participant, 'challenge_ending_soon', 'challenges',
  ..., 'challenge', challenge_id, '/community/boards?challenge=<id>')` for
  every `challenge_participants` row with `status = 'active'`, then stamps
  `ending_soon_notified_at`. Returns the count of `notifications` rows
  actually written (some may be suppressed by `notif_create`'s own filters).
  A second call after the column is stamped selects nothing for that
  challenge and writes nothing - this is what keeps the send to "at most
  once per `(challenge_id, user_id)` pair" without a per-user flag, per
  COMM-208's validation rule.
- **Now scheduled.** 202609050005 wired `cron.schedule('chal-notify-ending-soon',
  '23 * * * *', ...)` — hourly, so "ending soon" is never more than an hour
  late; the `ending_soon_notified_at` stamp makes the extra runs free. See
  "### The schedule (202609050005)" below for the full table.

### notif_on_challenge_join (AFTER INSERT on challenge_participants)

- Shipped in 202608290006.
- `notif_queue_batched(other, 'challenges', 'challenge_update',
  challenge_id)` for every other `challenge_participants` row on the same
  challenge with `status = 'active'`, guarded by `notif_blocked_between` and
  `notif_pref_allows(..., 'challenge_update')` - the same two checks
  `notif_on_reaction` uses before it enqueues. Never immediate. The joiner
  never receives a row about their own join, because the fan-out query
  excludes `cp.user_id = new.user_id`.

### notif_on_challenge_complete (AFTER UPDATE OF status on challenge_participants)

- Shipped in 202608290006. Same batched `challenge_update` fan-out to every
  other active participant, fired on the transition into `completed`.
- The trigger declaration fires on any UPDATE that includes `status` in its
  SET list, which `challenge_progress_apply`'s UPDATE always does even when
  the value does not actually change - so the function itself re-checks
  `new.status = 'completed' and old.status <> 'completed'` before doing
  anything, rather than relying on the trigger firing only on a real
  transition. The completer is excluded from the fan-out the same way the
  join trigger excludes the joiner (`cp.user_id <> new.user_id`) - they get
  a client-side celebration, never a notification about their own
  completion.

## Challenge team management (COMM-308)

Landed by schema in 202609010005. Everything in this section is Phase 3 and
sits on top of the COMM-006/COMM-204 tables unchanged: the four
`challenge_teams` policies still say exactly what they said in 202608280009,
so a `community.challenge.create` holder still creates, renames, and deletes
teams by direct RLS write and needs no function for any of it. What is new is
one column, two functions, and four triggers that constrain what those writes
may contain.

### challenge_teams.captain_id uuid references profiles(id) on delete set null

- Nullable, no default, not backfilled: null is the normal state and most
  teams never name a captain.
- A DISPLAY LABEL ONLY. Nothing in the schema reads this column to decide
  whether a write is allowed, and COMM-308 says so explicitly - the captain
  is not a delegated coach role.
- Two rules hold on every write path, both by trigger (see
  `challenge_teams_guard_captain` below), because neither is expressible as a
  constraint or a policy: the column is written only by `chal_set_captain`,
  and a non-null value is always a participant of that challenge whose
  `team_id` is that team and whose `status` is not `withdrawn`.
- "Active participant" throughout COMM-308 means `status <> 'withdrawn'`, not
  `status = 'active'`. A participant who COMPLETED the challenge finished it,
  they did not leave it: they still occupy a slot in the team column, still
  block that column's deletion, and are still a legitimate captain. The same
  predicate is used by all three rules here, which is what guarantees that a
  member who blocks a team's deletion can always be reassigned out of it.

### chal_reassign_team(p_challenge_id uuid, p_user_id uuid, p_team_id uuid) returns void

- Shipped in 202609010005.
- Purpose: the coach-only path for moving a participant between teams.
  `challenge_participants_update_self` only ever matches the member's own row
  (and after this migration, only their first team pick), so a staff write to
  someone else's participant row is a security definer function - the same
  reasoning and the same auth shape as `chal_record_progress`.
- Auth: security definer. Raises `not authorized` for a null caller or one
  without `community.challenge.create`.
- Refuses, all P0001: `challenge and target participant are required` (null
  id), `challenge not found`, `not a team challenge` for any `challenge_type`
  other than `team`, `not an active participant` when the target has no
  `challenge_participants` row on that challenge or is withdrawn (read `for
  update`), `team does not belong to this challenge` when `p_team_id` is a
  team of some other challenge.
- `p_team_id` null is allowed and means "out of every team" - how a column is
  emptied before it is deleted when the member should not land anywhere else.
- Side effects, one transaction: sets `challenge_participants.team_id`, and
  writes one `admin_actions` row (`action_type 'challenge_edit'`,
  `target_type 'challenge_participant'`, `target_id` the member -
  `challenge_participants` has a composite primary key and so no single row
  id; the challenge is in `before_data`/`after_data` alongside the old and
  new team). If the member captained the team they just left,
  `challenge_teams_release_captain` clears that `captain_id` in the same
  transaction.
- **IT NEVER TOUCHES `challenge_progress`.** This is COMM-308's central
  acceptance criterion and it is satisfied by the function's shape: one
  UPDATE, one column, one row. Every `challenge_progress.team_id` already
  stamped by `challenge_progress_stamp_team` (202608290003) keeps its value,
  so the deltas the member contributed while on their old team keep counting
  for that team in `chal_progress`'s `team_totals`, and only deltas logged
  after the call are stamped with the new team. A reassignment is just
  another way to depart a team, and "a departed member's earlier
  contributions keep counting for their old team" is the rule COMM-204 and
  `chal_progress` already state.
- Reassigning a member to the team they are already on is not special-cased:
  it writes the same value and still logs, so `before_data` and `after_data`
  are identical. That is an honest record of a coach action, not a bug.
- Revoked from public and anon, execute granted to authenticated - the
  permission check inside is the boundary.

### chal_set_captain(p_team_id uuid, p_user_id uuid) returns void

- Shipped in 202609010005.
- Purpose: the ONLY write path for `challenge_teams.captain_id`.
- Auth: security definer. Raises `not authorized` for a null caller or one
  without `community.challenge.create`.
- Refuses, all P0001: `team is required` (null `p_team_id`), `team not found`
  (read `for update`), and `captain must be an active participant on this
  team` when `p_user_id` has no `challenge_participants` row on that
  challenge whose `team_id` is this team and whose status is not
  `withdrawn`. `p_user_id` null clears the captain and is always allowed,
  per COMM-308's validation rules - the same "null means unassign, no second
  function" shape `coach_assign_coach` uses.
- Side effects: sets `captain_id` behind the transaction-local
  `app.allow_captain_set` pin, and writes one `admin_actions` row
  (`action_type 'challenge_edit'`, `target_type 'challenge_team'`,
  `target_id` the team, before/after carrying the old and new captain).
- Revoked from public and anon, execute granted to authenticated.

### challenge_teams_guard_captain (BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE OF captain_id on challenge_teams)

- Shipped in 202609010005. Two rules, one trigger.
- THE PIN: raises `captain is set through chal_set_captain` for any session
  where `auth.role()` is `authenticated` and the transaction-local
  `app.allow_captain_set` GUC is not `on`. `challenge_teams_update_perm`
  grants a holder a whole-row UPDATE, so without this a coach could set
  `captain_id` straight from the client and the audit row COMM-308 asks for
  would never exist. The permission half of the ticket's rule is already true
  by that policy; what a policy cannot say is "through this one function, so
  it is audited". Same GUC escape hatch `protect_is_admin` uses for
  `recovery_verified_at` and `assigned_coach_id`, and for the same reason:
  `auth.role()` still reads `authenticated` inside a definer function, so
  definer rights alone would not survive the trigger. Only
  `chal_set_captain` and `challenge_teams_release_captain` ever set the pin.
- It RAISES rather than silently reverting the way `protect_is_admin` does:
  that one guards a column on a row a member updates every day, where a hard
  error on an unrelated save would be hostile; here the only sessions that
  ever touch `captain_id` are staff ones doing it on purpose, and a silent
  no-op would leave a coach staring at a badge that never appears.
- THE INVARIANT, checked on every write path including the function and the
  service role: a non-null `captain_id` must be an active (not withdrawn)
  participant on this team, else `captain must be an active participant on
  this team`. `chal_set_captain` checks the same thing first so the client
  gets the function's message; both stand, the same way
  `recap_monthly_publish` and `monthly_club_recaps_freeze` both refuse a
  double publish.
- A write that leaves `captain_id` at the value it already had is never
  touched, so renaming a team - with or without a captain, with or without
  `captain_id` re-sent in the same statement - is unaffected.
- On INSERT the pin fires first, so a team is always created and captained in
  two steps. That is the only order that can ever be true anyway: nobody can
  be a participant on a team that did not exist a moment ago.

### challenge_teams_block_delete (BEFORE DELETE on challenge_teams)

- Shipped in 202609010005. Raises `team not empty` when any
  `challenge_participants` row still points at the team with `status <>
  'withdrawn'`. The column is emptied by `chal_reassign_team` first.
- COMM-308 left this open ("is refused (or the client blocks the action)").
  It is enforced in the database because `challenge_participants.team_id` is
  `on delete set null`: a client-only rule means one missed check silently
  empties a team column and its members just quietly stop having a team.
- CASCADE ESCAPE HATCH, load-bearing: the trigger returns early, allowing the
  delete, when the parent `challenges` row is already gone. `challenge_teams.
  challenge_id` is `on delete cascade`, and by the time an RI cascade fires
  the parent row has already left the deleting statement's snapshot - so
  "the challenge no longer exists" reliably means "this is a cascade, not a
  coach deleting one team". Without it, any team challenge with members would
  have become undeletable and `challenges_delete_perm` would have been broken
  by this ticket.
- A withdrawn participant does not block the delete. Their historical
  `challenge_progress` rows are a separate matter: `challenge_progress.
  team_id` is also `on delete set null` (202608290003), so deleting a team
  DOES null the snapshots on contributions made for it. That is pre-existing
  and outside COMM-308's scope - and it is exactly why the workflow is
  "empty the column by reassignment first" rather than "delete it and let it
  sort itself out". Reassignment never nulls a snapshot; deletion does.

### challenge_participants_guard_team (BEFORE UPDATE OF team_id on challenge_participants)

- Shipped in 202609010005. Raises `team already chosen` when an
  authenticated session without `community.challenge.create` changes a
  `team_id` that is already set - including clearing it to null, which would
  otherwise be the same move in two steps.
- **CORRECTION TO A STATED PREMISE.** COMM-308 (and COMM-204 before it)
  describes `challenge_participants_update_self` as already not permitting a
  member to set `team_id` to a value they did not pick at join. Read the
  policy: it is `using (user_id = auth.uid() or has_perm(...))` with the same
  WITH CHECK and NO column restriction at all, so as shipped a member could
  move themselves between teams as often as they liked, including onto
  whichever team was winning on the last day. The premise was not true. This
  trigger is what makes it true, and it is the reason `chal_reassign_team`
  has to exist at all.
- It has to be a trigger, not a policy: a policy's USING sees the old row and
  its WITH CHECK sees the new one, and neither can see both, so "this column
  may not change" has nowhere to live in RLS.
- The rule is "a member may set `team_id` once, from null", not "a member may
  never set `team_id`", because the shipped COMM-204 client depends on the
  first: `joinChallenge` inserts the participant row with no team, then
  either `autoAssignChallengeTeam` (join_mode `auto`) or `pickChallengeTeam`
  (the "הצטרפות לקבוצה" button) sets it. That button is already rendered only
  when the member has no team (`canPick = myParticipant && !myTeamId`), so
  the client has always treated the choice as one-time; the server now
  agrees. Nothing in the shipped client is refused by this.
- This only narrows `challenge_participants_update_self`, and only for
  `team_id`. The rest of that policy is untouched: a member still edits their
  own `status` and `progress_value` directly, which is what COMM-205's
  consistency "mark complete" tap does. Whether THAT should stay open is a
  separate, pre-existing question this ticket did not touch.
- Skipped entirely when `auth.role()` is not `authenticated`, the same
  scoping `protect_is_admin` uses, so the service role, a dashboard fix and a
  future backfill are unaffected. A `community.challenge.create` holder
  passes it, which is how `chal_reassign_team`'s own UPDATE gets through.

### challenge_teams_release_captain (AFTER DELETE OR UPDATE OF team_id, status on challenge_participants)

- Shipped in 202609010005. Clears `challenge_teams.captain_id` when the
  member named there is no longer an active (not withdrawn) participant on
  that team.
- It lives on `challenge_participants` rather than inside
  `chal_reassign_team` because leave (`challenge_participants_leave_self`
  deletes the row) and withdraw are plain client writes that never go near
  that function, and a rule enforced in one of three paths is not enforced.
- Sets the `app.allow_captain_set` pin around its one UPDATE - it runs inside
  the leaving member's own authenticated session, where
  `challenge_teams_guard_captain` would otherwise refuse the write and a
  member would be unable to leave a challenge they captained. This is the
  only other place that pin is ever set. Widening the pin instead ("clearing
  to null is always allowed") was the alternative and is worse: it would let
  a coach null a captain by direct client UPDATE with no audit row, which is
  the hole the pin exists to close.
- Writes no `admin_actions` row: this is a consequence of a member's own
  action, not a staff decision, and where a staff action caused it
  (`chal_reassign_team`) that action is already logged.

### admin_actions target_type, twelfth and thirteenth values (202609010005)

- `'challenge_participant'`, named by COMM-308 in as many words, and
  `'challenge_team'`, this migration's own choice for `chal_set_captain`.
  Neither fits an existing value: the subject of a reassignment is one
  member's membership of one challenge (not the `challenge`, whose row is
  untouched, and not the `member`, since nothing about the profile changes
  and a `member` target in this log has always meant a moderation action
  against a person), and the subject of a captain change is one
  `challenge_teams` row.
- `action_type` is NOT widened, unlike 202609010001 and 202609010002 which
  each described a genuinely new kind of staff act. Both functions here are
  an edit to a challenge's setup by a `community.challenge.create` holder,
  which is what the existing `'challenge_edit'` label already means; a new
  label would split one concept across two filters in `admin_actions_page`
  for no reader's benefit.

## Needs from schema, challenges

Closed. See "## Challenges" and "## Challenge team management (COMM-308)"
above.

## Events

### event_rsvp(p_event_id uuid, p_response text) returns void

- Shipped in 202608280010.
- Purpose: set the caller's RSVP with capacity and deadline checks.
- Params: `p_response` one of going, interested, not_going.
- Auth: security definer. Requires `is_community_member()`. Rejects an event
  that is not published.
- Side effects: upserts one event_attendees row. Capacity and deadline are
  enforced by the `event_attendees_capacity` trigger rather than by this
  function, so a direct RLS upsert hits the same checks. It raises
  `event_full` or `registration_closed`.

### AFTER UPDATE OF status on public.events - notif_on_event_cancelled()

- Shipped in 202608290009 (COMM-214). Definer, no grant to any client role.
  Trigger name `events_notify_cancelled`.
- Purpose: an event that gets cancelled tells the members who were going.
- Fires on the transition into `cancelled` only. As with
  `notif_on_challenge_complete`, `AFTER UPDATE OF status` fires on any
  UPDATE whose SET list mentions `status`, including one that writes the
  same value back, so the function re-checks `new.status = 'cancelled' and
  old.status <> 'cancelled'` itself and returns early otherwise.
- Recipients: every `event_attendees` row on the event with `response` in
  `going` or `interested`. A `not_going` RSVP is an opt-out and is never
  notified. A draft event needs no special case - it can have no attendees,
  so the loop is empty.
- `notif_create(<attendee>, 'event_cancelled', 'events', 'Event cancelled',
  <events.title>, 'event', <events.id>, '/community/feed?event=<id>')` per
  recipient. Immediate per the routing table, never batched.
- Because delivery goes through `notif_create`, the block edge, the `off`
  preference, the never-notify-the-actor rule, and the dedupe window are
  applied there and are not duplicated in the trigger: the staff member who
  cancelled is the actor and so never notifies themselves even when they
  hold a `going` RSVP; an attendee on either side of a block edge with the
  canceller is skipped; and the dedupe key (recipient, `event_cancelled`,
  event id) makes a cancel -> republish -> cancel inside
  `notif_dedupe_window()` one cancellation rather than two.
- Also in 202608290009: `notif_pref_key` gains one arm, `event_cancelled`
  -> `events`. See its entry below.

## Needs from schema, events

Functions and columns the Phase 2 events cluster (COMM-213 to COMM-217)
needs and that schema still owns. `events` and `event_attendees` themselves,
`event_rsvp`, and the capacity/deadline trigger all shipped in 202608280010
(COMM-007). Creating, editing, and cancelling an event are direct RLS writes
under the existing `community.event.manage`-gated policies, no new function.

- Closed. `notif_on_event_cancelled` shipped in 202608290009 and is
  documented under "## Events" above, with the `notif_pref_key` arm it
  needed. It was the only schema change this cluster asked for; the two
  items below were already "no schema change" and stay that way.
- Event comments (COMM-216) need no new table: publishing an event creates
  one companion `POST_EVENT` `workout_posts` row via `post_create` with
  `links.event_id`, and the event detail's comment thread is that post's
  `post_comments`, reusing `add_post_comment` and every engagement rule
  (COMM-121 to COMM-125) unchanged. This is a client-side design decision by
  the events agent, not a schema change, recorded here so it does not drift:
  `events` gets no `post_id` column, the link travels through
  `workout_posts.metadata->>'event_id'` the same way `post_create`'s `links`
  parameter already stores `event_id` today.
- Add to Calendar (COMM-215) is a client-only `.ics` file built from fields
  already on the `events` row. No schema change.

## Engagement

### comment_edit(p_comment_id uuid, p_body text) returns void

- Shipped in 202608280016.
- Purpose: the only edit path for a comment body. `post_comments` has no
  UPDATE grant, which is what makes it the only one.
- Params: `p_body` trimmed to 1000 chars. An all-whitespace body raises.
- Auth: security definer, author only. It also re-checks
  `is_community_member()` and `is_posting_restricted()`, because otherwise
  rewriting an old comment into new content is the obvious way around a
  COMM-153 restriction. Rate limited at 30 per 10 minutes under the
  `comment_edit` action key.
- Side effects: always stamps `edited_at`, so an edit can never be silent.
  Refuses a comment that is already removed or soft-deleted.

### add_post_comment(p_post_id uuid, p_body text, p_parent_comment_id uuid) returns uuid

- Shipped in 202608280016. Three-argument form.
- Purpose: create a top-level comment or a reply, one write path.
- Params: `p_body` trimmed to 1000 chars, up from 280. A null
  `p_parent_comment_id` is a top-level comment.
- Auth: security definer. Requires `is_community_member()`, then refuses a
  member with an active posting restriction, then the existing rate limit of
  20 per 10 minutes, then `post_visible_to_viewer()`. The restriction check
  runs before the rate limit so a restricted member burns no budget and gets
  the accurate reason.
- Raises: `posting_restricted`, `rate_limited`, `reply depth is capped at
  2`, `parent comment is on another post`, `parent comment is no longer
  available`.
- Side effects: one `post_comments` row. Depth is checked here and again by
  the `post_comments_depth` trigger, so a future write path cannot skip it.

### add_post_comment(p_post_id uuid, p_body text, p_parent_comment_id uuid, p_mentions uuid[]) returns uuid

- Shipped in 202608280021. Four-argument form, the one the mention path uses.
- Purpose: create a comment or reply and record its accepted mentions in the
  same transaction.
- Params: the first three are the three-argument form, unchanged. `p_mentions`
  is up to 10 user ids. Null or empty is the same call as the three-argument
  form. Over 10 raises `at most 10 mentions per comment`, checked before the
  comment row is written, because a comment that mentions 40 members is a
  fan-out, not a mention.
- Auth: security definer. It delegates the whole create path to the
  three-argument function, so the recovery gate, the posting restriction, the
  rate limit, the visibility check, and the depth cap are checked in one
  place and cannot drift between signatures.
- Each target is de-duplicated, the caller's own id is dropped, and each
  remaining id must be a live profile and pass
  `can_view_profile_field(target, 'allow_mentions')`, which is already false
  across a block edge. A target that fails is skipped, not raised: the client
  has already rewritten those to plain text, so a raise would turn "your
  mention did not go through" into "your comment did not go through".
- Side effects: one `post_comments` row plus one `comment_mentions` row per
  accepted target.

### comment_delete(p_comment_id uuid) returns void

- Shipped in 202608280021.
- Purpose: the soft self-delete path. Sets `status = 'removed'`,
  `deleted_at = now()`, and `deleted_by = auth.uid()`.
- Auth: security definer, author only. Deliberately carries no
  `is_community_member()` and no `is_posting_restricted()` gate: removing
  your own words is not a community write, and a restricted or not yet
  verified member must always be able to take their content down. Same
  reasoning `toggle_reaction` uses for removing your own reaction.
- Idempotent, and it does not re-stamp. A comment already removed by a
  moderator returns quietly and keeps its `deleted_by`, so the `admin_actions`
  row still points at a comment that agrees with it.
- It is a function rather than a narrow own-row UPDATE policy because a
  policy sees whole rows, not columns. An own-row UPDATE policy would also
  hand the author a second body-edit path that skips `comment_edit`'s
  restriction check and its mandatory `edited_at` stamp. `post_comments`
  still has no UPDATE grant, so `comment_edit` and `comment_delete` are the
  complete list of ways a comment can change.
- The hard-delete policy `post_comments_delete_self` is untouched, so the
  current `deleteComment` keeps working until the client switches over.

### add_post_comment(p_post_id uuid, p_body text) returns uuid

- Shipped in 202608270010, rewritten in 202608280005 and again in
  202608280016 as a wrapper passing a null parent. Kept so the current
  client keeps working while engagement wires the parent argument through
  COMM-121. It is a separate two-argument function rather than a default
  parameter on the three-argument one: a default would make the client's
  existing two-argument call ambiguous and fail at call time. Same pattern
  `redeem_invite_code` used in 202608280013.

- Note: comment create and delete keep the existing `addComment` and
  `deleteComment` client functions, `addComment` gains an optional
  `parentCommentId`. Reply depth cap 2 is enforced by the
  `post_comments_depth` trigger, not by a CHECK. `deleteComment` still hard
  deletes under the author-only `post_comments_delete_self` policy, which
  flattens replies to top level. The soft path now exists server-side as
  `comment_delete(p_comment_id)`, shipped in 202608280021, so switching
  `deleteComment` to call it is client work and needs no further migration.

### Engagement client contract (renderComments and react), COMM-120 to 125

Finalised by engagement. Owned here, consumed by the posts card shell, which
appends `renderComments(post)` inside the article and exposes
`data-community-action="cheer"` and `"toggle-comments"` on `.post-actions`.

- `react(postId)` toggles the single `SUPPORT` reaction. The database keeps
  `reactions.kind = 'cheer'` and `toggle_reaction(p_post_id)` unchanged. The
  UI is optimistic: the reactor avatar strip and the count move before the
  server answers and roll back with a message on failure. On a successful
  add it emits `REACTION_CREATED` with `{ post_id }`. A removal emits
  nothing. The `react` feed interaction is still recorded by the card click,
  not by this function.
- `renderComments(post)` returns the reactor strip plus, when the thread is
  open, the comment list and composer. The strip is
  `<div class="reaction-strip">` with up to 5 `.avatar-badge` nodes and the
  total. It renders whenever `reaction_count > 0` or the thread is open, so
  the card markup itself is never touched. A closed thread returns the strip
  alone, or an empty string when there is nothing to show.
- A coach or head_coach comment carries `<span class="coach-badge">` with
  the role label, the wrapper class `comment-coach`, and a tinted
  inline-start border. The role is read from `invite_redemptions.role` for
  each author, never guessed.
- Replies render one indent level under a `data-community-action=
  "toggle-replies"` control. A reply carries no reply affordance. A reply
  whose `parent_comment_id` is absent from the returned page renders a
  "comment removed" placeholder parent. A blocked author's comment renders a
  neutral "comment hidden" placeholder, and a blocked reactor is dropped
  from the strip. Block state is `state.blockedIds`, loaded on session start
  from `blocks` in both directions.
- Comment drafts live in `state.commentDrafts` keyed by
  `postId` or `postId:parentCommentId` and are cleared only after the server
  confirms the write. A failed create or edit keeps the draft and shows a
  `data-community-action="comment-retry"` control.
- Mentions: an `@` in the composer opens a member picker. A pick inserts the
  marker `@[Display Name](uuid)` into the draft. On send, each mention is
  checked with `can_view_profile_field(target, 'allow_mentions')`, which is
  also false across a block edge. A mention that fails the check is rewritten
  to plain `@Name` text before the write. The surviving mentions ride
  `COMMENT_CREATED` as `mentions: [{ user_id, name }]` (max 10), alongside
  `{ post_id, comment_id, parent_comment_id, author_id }`, and drive the
  client-side celebration and draft handling only.
- Superseded in part by 202608280021: the surviving mention ids are also
  sent as `p_mentions` on the four-argument `add_post_comment`, which
  re-checks each one with `can_view_profile_field(target, 'allow_mentions')`
  and writes a `comment_mentions` row per accepted target. That table, not
  the client event, is what the notification trigger reads, so the mention
  notification does not depend on the browser telling the truth. The bus
  event stays as it is and remains client-only.

## Notifications

### notif_list(p_cursor timestamptz, p_limit integer) returns setof notifications

- Shipped in 202608280008.
- Purpose: the caller's notification stream, newest first, grouped client-side
  by category. `p_limit` clamped to 1 to 40, default 20.
- Auth: security invoker, so the own-row select policy is what scopes it.

### notif_mark_read(p_ids uuid[]) returns void

- Shipped in 202608280008.
- Auth: security definer, own-row. Up to 100 ids per call. A null or empty
  array is a no-op.

### notif_unread_count() returns integer

- Shipped in 202608280008.
- Auth: security invoker, own-row.

### notification_batch_window() returns interval

- Shipped in 202608280018. Immutable, returns 6 hours.
- Purpose: the batching window in one place, so the column default and a
  test assert against the same value and neither can drift. COMM-142 fixes
  it at 6 hours.
- Auth: security invoker, granted to authenticated so a test can read it.

### notif_queue_batched(p_user uuid, p_category text, p_type text, p_source_id uuid) returns void

- Shipped in 202608280018. `p_source_id` defaults to null.
- Purpose: add one item to a member's open batch for a category. Upserts on
  `(user_id, category)`, increments `pending_count`, and increments the
  per-type counter inside `pending`.
- Auth: security definer with no grant to anon or authenticated, so it is
  callable only from inside another server function or by the service role.
  It does not check `auth.uid()`, deliberately: it always acts on a member
  other than the actor, so a caller identity test would assert nothing. The
  missing grant is the boundary here.
- Side effects: an empty batch starts a fresh window. A batch that already
  holds something keeps its original `next_flush_at`, so a steady trickle
  cannot push the flush out forever.
- Raises: on an unknown category or a type that does not match the same
  pattern `notifications.type` uses.

### notif_batch_flushed(p_user uuid, p_category text) returns void

- Shipped in 202608280018.
- Purpose: called by the flusher after it has written the rolled-up
  `notifications` row. Zeroes the counters, stamps `last_flushed_at`, and
  arms the next window.
- Auth: same as `notif_queue_batched`, no grant to anon or authenticated.
- Side effects: idempotent. A second call on an already-empty batch changes
  nothing but `last_flushed_at`.

### notif_create(p_user uuid, p_type text, p_category text, p_title text, p_body text, p_source_type text, p_source_id uuid, p_deep_link text) returns uuid

- Shipped in 202608280026. The one immediate-notification insert path into
  `public.notifications`, which has no insert grant. Called only from a
  trigger, another definer function, or the service role.
- Auth: security definer. **Grant execute to nothing** - revoked from
  public, anon, and authenticated. It reads `auth.uid()` only to identify
  the actor for the self-notify and block-edge filters, never as an
  identity gate, exactly as `notif_queue_batched` does: it always acts on a
  member other than the caller, so a caller check would assert nothing and
  the missing grant is the boundary. A null `auth.uid()` (service role,
  cron) skips both filters.
- Returns the new row id, or `NULL` when the row was suppressed by any of:
  - recipient equals the actor, except the self-directed types
    `achievement_unlocked` and `weekly_recap` whose whole purpose is the
    actor's own stream
  - a block edge in either direction between recipient and actor
  - the recipient has a `notification_preferences.channel = 'off'` row for
    the type's preference key AND the row is not operational
  - an identical `(user_id, type, source_id)` row already exists inside
    `notif_dedupe_window()` (COMM-143 "no duplicate notification for the
    same event"); the source id passed by the trigger set is the specific
    event row (a comment id, a member_achievement id), so this only ever
    absorbs one event fired twice, never two real events
- Truncates title to 160 and body to 500 to match the column CHECKs.
- Side effects: at most one `notifications` row. `club_id` defaults through
  `default_club_id()`.
- Also in 202608280026: re-creates `notifications_deep_link_check` from
  202608280008 with a `{0,255}` regex bound instead of `{0,300}`. A
  Postgres regex repetition bound may not exceed 255, so the original
  constraint raised `invalid repetition count(s)` on every insert with a
  non-null `deep_link`. Nothing had ever written one before this run.

### notif_dedupe_window() returns interval

- Shipped in 202608280026. Immutable, returns `1 hour`. Granted to
  `authenticated` so a test asserts the same value the function uses.

### notif_pref_key / notif_pref_allows / notif_blocked_between / notif_is_operational

- Shipped in 202608280026 as internal helpers for `notif_create` and the
  trigger set. No grant to any client role.
- `notif_pref_key(p_type text) returns text` - maps a fine-grained
  `notifications.type` to the coarse `notification_preferences.type` key a
  settings screen shows. The mapping: `comment_reply` and `comment_on_post`
  and `comment_also` -> `comment_reply` / `comment_on_post` /
  `comment_on_post`; `mention` and `coach_mention` -> `mentions`;
  `reaction` -> `reactions`; `announcement` -> `announcements`;
  `friend_achievement` -> `friend_achievements`; `achievement_unlocked` ->
  `achievement_unlocked`; and, added in 202608290009, `event_cancelled` ->
  `events`. Anything else maps to itself.
- KNOWN DRIFT, do not treat this map as agreeing with the client yet. The
  client's preferences panel (`NOTIF_PREF_TYPES` in cloud.js) writes the
  coarse keys `comments`, `replies`, `mentions`, `reactions`,
  `achievements`, `friend_achievements`, `challenges`, `events`,
  `announcements`, `weekly_recap`. Only `mentions`, `reactions`,
  `friend_achievements`, `announcements`, and (since 202608290009) `events`
  line up. `comment_reply` maps to `comment_reply` where the client writes
  `replies`; `comment_on_post` / `comment_also` map to `comment_on_post`
  where the client writes `comments`; `achievement_unlocked` maps to itself
  where the client writes `achievements`; `challenge_ending_soon` and
  `challenge_update` fall through to themselves where the client writes
  `challenges`. For those five types an `off` toggle in the panel does not
  actually suppress delivery. 202608290009 fixed only `event_cancelled`,
  because that type had never been emitted before, so adding its arm could
  not change any shipped behaviour; re-keying the others changes live
  delivery for members who already set those toggles and belongs to the
  notifications cluster (COMM-218/219), with the matching client change.
- `notif_pref_allows(p_user uuid, p_type text) returns boolean` - false
  only when the user has an explicit `off` row on the mapped key. A missing
  row is `in_app`, i.e. allowed. The batched path checks this before
  `notif_queue_batched`, which reads no preferences itself.
- `notif_blocked_between(p_a uuid, p_b uuid) returns boolean` - a block
  edge in either direction; a null on either side is "no edge".
- `notif_is_operational(p_type text, p_source_id uuid) returns boolean` -
  true only for `announcement`, and, since 202608290010 (COMM-218/219), only
  when `announcements.priority in ('important', 'urgent')`. It read
  `announcements.important` up to that migration; because `important` is now
  kept as an exact mirror of `priority <> 'normal'`, the swap changed no
  existing row's answer. This is how an operational row overrides an `off`
  preference without adding a ninth parameter to `notif_create`.

### AFTER INSERT on public.post_comments - notif_on_comment()

- Shipped in 202608280027. Definer, no grant.
- Reply (`NEW.parent_comment_id` set, parent author `<> NEW.author_id`):
  `notif_create` for the parent author, type `comment_reply`, category
  `community`, deep link
  `/community/feed?post=<NEW.post_id>&comment=<NEW.parent_comment_id>`,
  source `comment` / `NEW.id`.
- Post author (when `<> NEW.author_id` and, on a reply, `<>` the parent
  author): `comment_on_post` immediate the first time that same commenter
  (`NEW.author_id`) comments on the post, otherwise
  `notif_queue_batched(post_author, 'community', 'comment_also',
  NEW.post_id)` guarded by `notif_blocked_between` and
  `notif_pref_allows(..., 'comment_also')`.
- Mentions are NOT handled here; see `notif_on_mention`.

### AFTER INSERT on public.comment_mentions - notif_on_mention()

- Shipped in 202608280027. Definer, no grant. One `notif_create` per row.
- Fires on `comment_mentions`, whose rows are written only by the
  four-argument `add_post_comment` after its own
  `can_view_profile_field(target, 'allow_mentions')` recheck. The client
  `COMMENT_CREATED` mention array is never read by any server path.
- Type `coach_mention` when the comment author holds `coach` or
  `head_coach` in `invite_redemptions.role`, else `mention`. Category
  `community`, deep link
  `/community/feed?post=<post_id>&comment=<comment_id>`. `notif_create`
  then applies the target's `mentions` preference and the block-edge
  filter.

### AFTER INSERT on public.reactions - notif_on_reaction()

- Shipped in 202608280027. Definer, no grant. Built from the row:
  `REACTION_CREATED` carries only `{ post_id }`.
- When the post `author_id <> NEW.user_id` and no block edge and the
  author's `reactions` preference is not `off`:
  `notif_queue_batched(author, 'community', 'reaction', NEW.post_id)`.
  Never immediate.

### AFTER INSERT / AFTER UPDATE OF priority, important on public.announcements - notif_on_announcement()

- Shipped in 202608280027 (`AFTER UPDATE OF important`), widened in
  202608290010 to `AFTER UPDATE OF priority, important` (COMM-218/219). Both
  columns are named, not just `priority`: `UPDATE OF <col>` matches the
  columns in the statement's SET clause, not the values a BEFORE trigger
  writes, so a legacy `update announcements set important = true` would
  never fire an `of priority` trigger even though
  `announcements_priority_sync` has just moved the row up a tier. The
  trigger body decides on `priority` either way.
- INSERT: `notif_announcement_fanout(NEW.id, false)` - loops every club
  member (a profile with an `invite_redemptions` row, not deleted, not the
  author) and calls `notif_create` with type `announcement`, category
  `club`, deep link `/community/feed?announcement=<id>`. A `normal`
  announcement reaches members whose `announcements` preference is not
  `off`; an `important` or `urgent` one is operational and reaches everyone
  because `notif_is_operational` returns true.
- UPDATE: fans out when `announcement_priority_rank(NEW.priority) >
  announcement_priority_rank(OLD.priority)`, i.e. on any upward move on
  `normal < important < urgent`, via `notif_announcement_fanout(NEW.id,
  true)`. A downgrade fans out to nobody. `normal -> important` and `normal
  -> urgent` (skipping the middle tier) both reach the members the INSERT
  pass deliberately skipped; `important -> urgent` reaches nobody, because
  at `important` the row was already operational and every member holds a
  row. Up to 202608290010 this branch was the single boolean flip `important
  false -> true`.
- `notif_announcement_fanout(p_id uuid, p_off_only boolean) returns void`
  is an internal definer helper, no grant; the signature is unchanged since
  202608280027. `p_off_only` targets ONLY members with an explicit
  `announcements = off` row. Since 202608290010 the loop also skips any
  member who already holds a `notification` row for this announcement
  (`type = 'announcement'`, matching `source_id`), whatever their
  preference, so "one row per member per announcement, however many times
  priority moves" (COMM-219) holds structurally rather than depending on
  `notif_dedupe_window()`; and it returns without notifying anyone when the
  announcement is already past its `expires_at`, since the deep link would
  open onto a row the read policy hides. On the INSERT pass the
  already-notified filter matches nothing, so first fan-out behaviour is
  unchanged. The whole-club loop is the fan-out cost the routing table
  flags; Phase 1 is one small club.

### BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE on public.announcements - announcements_priority_sync()

- Shipped in 202608290010 (COMM-218). Internal trigger function, no grant to
  any client role, not security definer (it touches no table).
- Keeps `announcements.important` an exact mirror of `priority <> 'normal'`,
  in both directions, so the Phase 1 boolean stays readable AND writable and
  no other Phase 1 trigger, policy, or client build needs an edit. The
  contract allowed a generated column; a trigger mirror was chosen instead
  because `GENERATED ALWAYS` would turn every existing `insert into
  announcements (..., important)` and `update ... set important = true` into
  a hard error, and both spellings are live in the shipped pgTAP suite.
- Resolution, stated once: on INSERT a non-`normal` `priority` wins, else a
  true `important` is read as the `important` tier, else normal/false. On
  UPDATE, if `priority` changed it wins and `important` is recomputed from
  it; else if `important` changed, `priority` follows it (true ->
  `important`, false -> `normal`); else the pair is re-normalised, a no-op
  on a consistent row. `important = (priority <> 'normal')` is therefore an
  invariant of the table.

### announcement_priority_rank(p_priority text) returns integer

- Shipped in 202608290010. Purpose: the one definition of "upward" on the
  three tiers - `urgent` 2, `important` 1, anything else (including null) 0.
- Auth: pure, immutable, reads nothing. `revoke` from `public` and `anon`,
  `grant execute to authenticated`, so a client can order a badge list by
  the same rule the escalation trigger uses.
- Side effects: none.

### AFTER INSERT on public.member_achievements - notif_on_achievement()

- Shipped in 202608280027. Definer, no grant.
- DEVIATION from the brief's "server bus consumer" wording: run 2
  confirmed there is no server-side product-event bus in the repo
  (`ACHIEVEMENT_UNLOCKED`, like `POST_CREATED`, is a client-only emit). Per
  the brief's own fallback instruction, this is wired off an AFTER INSERT
  trigger on `member_achievements`, the same shape as `notif_on_reaction`.
  Both `ach_claim` and a future `ach_evaluate` write that row.
- Unlocker: `notif_create(NEW.user_id, 'achievement_unlocked', 'training',
  ...)`, deep link `/community/account/achievements?ma=<NEW.id>`.
  `achievement_unlocked` is a self-directed type so `notif_create` allows
  recipient == actor for it.
- Friend fan-out, only when the unlocker's profile has `visible_to_club`
  and `show_achievements` on and `NEW.visibility <> 'only_me'`: for each
  member in a mutual-follow edge with the unlocker (the `are_friends`
  definition, computed directly rather than via the caller-relative
  helper), with no block edge and `friend_achievements` not `off`:
  `notif_queue_batched(friend, 'training', 'friend_achievement', NEW.id)`.

### notif_batch_flush_due(p_limit integer default 500) returns integer

- Shipped in 202608280028. The batch flusher. Security definer, granted to
  `service_role` only (the `purge_due_accounts` pattern).
- Selects `notification_batches` where `next_flush_at <= now() and
  pending_count > 0`, ordered by `next_flush_at`, up to `p_limit` rows. For
  each, writes one `notifications` row per type in `pending`, keeping the
  batched type key as `notifications.type` so the client folds it as a
  batched group, then calls `notif_batch_flushed(user_id, category)`.
  Returns the count of `notifications` rows written.
- Title and body are composed from the per-type `count`. Deep link is
  `/community/feed?post=<last_source_id>` when that type is the only thing
  in the batch (`count = pending_count`) and it is `reaction` or
  `comment_also`; otherwise the category surface from
  `notif_category_surface`.
- This is the SECOND server-side insert path into `notifications`. It does
  NOT re-run the preference, block-edge, or de-dupe filters: every item was
  already filtered at enqueue time by the trigger that called
  `notif_queue_batched`, and a rolled-up row is by definition not a
  duplicate.
- **Now scheduled.** 202609050005 wired exactly the entry this section
  proposed: `cron.schedule('notif-batch-flush', '*/15 * * * *', $$select
  public.notif_batch_flush_due()$$)`. Batched notifications no longer
  accumulate in `notification_batches` undelivered.

### notif_category_surface(p_category text) returns text

- Shipped in 202608280028. Internal, no grant. Maps a `notifications`
  category to an in-app surface: `community` and `events` and `club` ->
  `/community/feed`, `training` -> `/community/account/achievements`,
  `challenges` -> `/community/boards`.

- Note: notifications are created only server-side, by triggers and event-bus
  consumers. There is no insert policy and no insert grant on the table.
  Batching state lives in `notification_batches`, shipped in 202608280018
  under COMM-142. It holds counters only, never notification content, has an
  own-row select policy and no write grant, and the flush routing itself is
  notifications agent work. `notification_preferences` is a direct RLS
  upsert, and a missing row means in_app.
- Note: the own-row UPDATE policy exists for `read_at`. A
  `notifications_protect_content` trigger pins every other column on an
  authenticated request, so a member cannot rewrite the body of a
  notification the server sent them.

- Client contract, COMM-140 to 144. The client reads with `notif_list`,
  marks read with `notif_mark_read`, and reads the badge from
  `notif_unread_count`. It never selects `notifications` directly. It
  refreshes the badge on centre open, on app focus, and on a realtime
  own-row event on `notifications` filtered to `user_id=eq.<self>`
  (replication for that table is COMM-227, so the subscription is a no-op
  until then). `notification_preferences` is a direct own-row RLS upsert on
  `(user_id, type)` with `channel` in `push`, `in_app`, `off`; a missing
  row is `in_app`. `push` is disabled in the V1 client (`NOTIF_PUSH_ENABLED
  = false`) and a stored `push` is read as `in_app`. The client renders an
  immediate notification as its own row and folds a run of same-type
  batched rows into one collapsed group. It resolves `deep_link` (or
  `source_type`/`source_id` as a fallback) to a screen and item with the
  route convention below.

- Deep link route convention (client `resolveNotifTarget`). All routes are
  `^/[A-Za-z0-9_/?=&.%-]{0,300}$`, matching the `deep_link` CHECK:
  - `/community/feed?post=<post_id>&comment=<comment_id>` - a comment,
    reply, mention, or reaction. `comment` is optional.
  - `/community/account/achievements?ma=<member_achievement_id>` - an
    achievement unlock.
  - `/community/feed?announcement=<announcement_id>` - an announcement.
  - `/community/boards?challenge=<challenge_id>` - a challenge item.
  - `/community/account/profile?user=<user_id>` - a friend's achievement.
  - `/community/feed?event=<event_id>` - an event cancellation.
  A row with no `deep_link` falls back to `source_type` in `post`,
  `comment`, `achievement`, `announcement`, `challenge`, `event`,
  `profile` with `source_id`.

## Needs from schema, notifications

Shipped by schema in 202608280026 through 202608280028. The notifications
server side (COMM-140 to 144) is now fully backed: `notif_create`, the
`notif_dedupe_window` / `notif_pref_key` / `notif_pref_allows` /
`notif_blocked_between` / `notif_is_operational` helpers, the AFTER INSERT
trigger set (`notif_on_comment`, `notif_on_mention`, `notif_on_reaction`,
`notif_on_announcement` + `notif_announcement_fanout`,
`notif_on_achievement`), the `announcements.important` column (joined in
202608290010 by `announcements.priority`, which is now the source of truth
behind it), and the
batch flusher (`notif_batch_flush_due` + `notif_category_surface`) are all
documented under "## Notifications" above. `notif_list`, `notif_mark_read`,
`notif_unread_count`, `notif_queue_batched`, `notif_batch_flushed` and
`notification_batch_window` were already shipped (202608280008 /
202608280018). The routing table and the later-phase type list stay here
as reference.

Deviations from the run-3 brief, all reflected above:
- The `ACHIEVEMENT_UNLOCKED` path is an AFTER INSERT trigger on
  `member_achievements`, not a server-bus consumer, because run 2
  confirmed no server-side product-event bus exists. This is the fallback
  the brief itself specifies for that case.
- 202608280026 also re-creates `notifications_deep_link_check` (from
  202608280008) with a `{0,255}` regex bound: a Postgres repetition bound
  cannot exceed 255, so the original `{0,300}` raised `invalid repetition
  count(s)` on the first insert with a non-null `deep_link` - which this
  run is.
- Announcement escalation (normal -> important) notifies only the members
  with an explicit `announcements = off` row, so there is no double-notify
  window: the members who already got the row on insert are never in the
  escalation loop, and the `notif_dedupe_window` guard is a second line
  rather than the mechanism.
- The batch flusher SCHEDULER (pg_cron / Edge Function) is infra and is
  not built or enabled here; see the note on `notif_batch_flush_due`.

### The immediate / batched / never routing table

The single split, so the trigger set and the client `notifRoute()` agree.
`notification_batch_window()` is 6 hours.

- Immediate (its own `notifications` row, written now): `comment_reply`,
  `comment_on_post`, `mention`, `coach_mention`, `achievement_unlocked`,
  `announcement` (operational, always), `challenge_ending_soon` (joined
  participants only), `event_cancelled`, `new_report` (moderators only,
  202609050003).
- Batched (`notif_queue_batched`, rolled up by the flusher into one row per
  type per window): `reaction`, `comment_also`, `friend_achievement`,
  `challenge_update`, `feed_activity`, `weekly_recap`.
- Never generated: a notification per post, per workout, per leaderboard
  movement. No type exists for these and no trigger enqueues them.
- A `notification_preferences.channel = 'off'` row suppresses both the
  immediate insert and the batch enqueue, except `announcement` when the
  announcement is operational. A missing preference row is `in_app`.
- Every recipient is filtered by a block edge in either direction. The
  recipient is never the actor.

### Later-phase types, named for completeness

- `challenge_ending_soon` (immediate, joined participants only) and
  `challenge_update` (batched): COMM-208, Phase 2.
- `event_cancelled` (immediate): COMM-214, shipped in 202608290009. The
  only type whose `notif_pref_key` arm matches the client's panel key
  (`events`) on the server side today.
- `weekly_recap` (batched): the `recap_weekly` Edge Function (COMM-220)
  calls `notif_create(U, 'weekly_recap', 'club', ...)` once per user per
  week, deep link to the recap surface.
- `feed_activity` (batched): a catch-all, only ever enqueued, never
  immediate, never per-post.
- `monthly_club_recap` (immediate): COMM-309, shipped in 202609010002.
  `recap_monthly_publish(p_id)` calls `notif_create(M, 'monthly_club_recap',
  'club', …)` once per club member at the moment a staff member publishes a
  monthly recap — never at generation. Immediate rather than batched: it
  fires at most twelve times a year and is a deliberate human act, so there
  is nothing to roll up. It has no `notif_pref_key` arm, so the preference
  key is the type itself; the body is club aggregate figures only, with no
  member named anywhere. Deep link `/community/recap/monthly?month=<the
  month's first day>`.
- `new_report` (immediate, moderators only): shipped in 202609050003 by the
  `reports_notify_moderators` trigger. It has no `notif_pref_key` arm, so the
  preference key is the type itself and a moderator can mute it with one
  `notification_preferences` row — the queue is still there for them.
  `notifications.type` needed no change to accept it: that column is a regex
  CHECK (`^[a-z][a-z0-9_.]{2,63}$`, 202608280008), not a closed list.

## Needs from schema, notifications (Phase 2)

Trigger set and columns the Phase 2 notifications cluster (COMM-208,
COMM-214/215, COMM-218/219, COMM-229) needs and that schema still owns. The
Phase 1 trigger set (`notif_on_comment`, `notif_on_mention`,
`notif_on_reaction`, `notif_on_announcement`, `notif_on_achievement`) and
`notif_create` itself need no signature change; every item below is either a
new trigger of the same shape or a small predicate change inside an existing
one.

The challenges-specific part of this list (COMM-208) shipped in 202608290006:
`notif_on_challenge_join`, `notif_on_challenge_complete`, and
`chal_notify_ending_soon()` plus `challenges.ending_soon_notified_at` are
documented under "## Challenges" above, not here.

- `notif_on_event_cancelled`: immediate `event_cancelled`. Shipped in
  202608290009 along with the `event_cancelled` -> `events` arm of
  `notif_pref_key`; documented under "## Events" above, not here.
- `notif_is_operational` widening to `announcements.priority in
  ('important', 'urgent')`, the widened AFTER UPDATE trigger, and the
  three-tier re-fan-out logic (COMM-218, COMM-219) all shipped in
  202608290010 and are documented under "## Notifications" above, not here:
  see `notif_pref_key / notif_pref_allows / notif_blocked_between /
  notif_is_operational`, `AFTER INSERT / AFTER UPDATE OF priority, important
  on public.announcements`, `BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE on
  public.announcements`, and `announcement_priority_rank`. One deviation
  from the wording of this list, deliberate and covered there: the trigger's
  column list is `OF priority, important`, both columns rather than
  `priority` alone, because `UPDATE OF` matches the statement's SET clause
  and a legacy `set important = true` would otherwise stop firing. See
  "Needs from schema, admin-moderation (Phase 2)" for the column migration.
- COMM-219 needed no `notification_preferences` change and none was made:
  the ticket is explicit that the coarse `announcements` key from COMM-144
  is the only preference row involved, that the urgent path routes through
  the same `notif_create` immediate path rather than a second mechanism, and
  that the preferences panel gains no new row. The urgent "bypass" of a
  member's `off` row is `notif_is_operational` answering true, which is the
  Phase 1 mechanism unchanged.
- `notif_push_send`: **BUILT 2026-09-17** (was: "NOT built here"). The Web
  Push send exists as a service-role Edge Function
  (`supabase/functions/notif_push_send`), scheduled every three minutes as
  the `notif-push-send` pg_cron job through `cron_invoke_edge_function`, the
  same bridge `recap_weekly` uses. A real VAPID keypair replaced COMM-229's
  demo one; the private half is an Edge Function secret.

  The selection is deliberately NOT in the function. `notif_push_pending`,
  `notif_push_mark_sent` and `notif_push_revoke` (202609170002, service_role
  only) decide who is owed a delivery, and `supabase/tests/0114` tests that
  against a real Postgres. The function fetches, encrypts and posts.

  Encryption is `_shared/webPush.mjs` (RFC 8291 + 8292, WebCrypto), verified
  against RFC 8291's published example in `test/web-push-crypto.test.mjs` -
  the same file the function imports, because a wrong byte here returns 201
  from the push service and shows nothing on the phone.

## Identity and privacy

### redeem_invite_code(p_code text, p_actor_key text) returns text

- Shipped in 202608280013.
- Purpose: redeem an invite, rate limited by a stable actor signal, not only
  the Auth user id.
- Params: `p_actor_key` opaque, up to 128 chars. It is sha256 hashed before
  it reaches a column, so the raw key is never stored or logged with the
  code. A null, empty, or over-long key falls back to the uid key alone.
- Returns: the granted role on success, `invalid`, or `rate_limited`. It
  never raises, so a caller cannot tell the three apart by error shape.
- Auth: authenticated caller. Five attempts per fifteen minutes, counted
  against the uid key AND the actor key, whichever is higher. Same generic
  answer and the same increment regardless of whether the actor is new.
- Side effects: on success, writes the redemption and the role.

### redeem_invite_code(p_code text) returns text

- Shipped in 202608270006, rewritten in 202608280013 as a wrapper that
  passes a null actor key. Kept so the current client keeps working while
  identity-privacy wires the actor key through COMM-017. Behaviour with no
  actor key is the uid-keyed throttle, exactly as before.

### can_view_profile_field(p_target uuid, p_field text) returns boolean

- Shipped in 202608280003.
- Purpose: resolve the caller against the target's privacy toggles and block
  edges for one field. Feed, profile, leaderboard, and search all route
  through this so they cannot drift apart.
- Params: `p_field` one of visible_to_club, show_workout_results,
  show_attendance, show_upcoming_booking, show_prs, show_achievements,
  in_leaderboards, allow_follows, allow_mentions, allow_messages,
  show_in_attendee_lists. An unknown name raises. There is no `show_birthday`
  and there is no birth date column, per the 2026-08-28 decision.
- Auth: security definer, raises nothing for a null caller and returns false.
  It reads the target's row, which the caller may not be able to select once
  `visible_to_club` is off, and only ever answers about the caller's own view.
- Notes: self always true. A block edge in either direction returns false
  before any toggle is read. A real admin passes. `show_in_attendee_lists`
  is ANDed with the club-wide `clubs.attendee_lists_enabled` override, which
  can only ever subtract from the member's own choice.

### mark_recovery_verified() returns timestamptz

- Shipped in 202608280003.
- Purpose: stamp `profiles.recovery_verified_at`, which is what
  `is_community_member()` requires. This is the only client-reachable way to
  set it.
- Auth: security definer. It refuses unless auth.users says the caller really
  has an email, a password, and a confirmed email, so the gate cannot be
  self-certified. The column is pinned on both the profiles update trigger
  and the insert policy, so no direct write can set it.
- Side effects: idempotent. An already-verified profile keeps its original
  timestamp.

### is_community_member() returns boolean

- Shipped in 202608280003. Re-declared in 202609060001 with the same
  signature and the same meaning, as **security definer**.
- Purpose: the community access predicate. True when the caller has a live
  profile, a non-null `recovery_verified_at`, and an invite redemption.
- Used by: post insert, comment create, reaction create, challenge join,
  challenge progress, event RSVP, and post_media insert — **and, since
  202609060001, by the three member-data READ policies as well**:
  `profiles_read_authenticated`, `posts_feed_select` and
  `announcements_read`, plus the `community_streaks` view and the
  `avatar-photos` SELECT policy.
- **The read gate reverses this entry's original "read paths are deliberately
  not gated" line, and on purpose.** That line was written before anonymous
  sign-in was enabled. With it on and the publishable key in the browser,
  anyone can mint a real `authenticated` JWT with no invite, no profile and
  no recovery method, and every one of those relations answered them in full
  — verified live. The reserved read window it protected is also unreachable
  in the shipped client: `renderCommunityApp()` returns the COMM-016 recovery
  card and nothing else while `recovery_verified_at` is null, and
  `ensureCommunityDataLoaded()` runs no loader at all until it is stamped.
- The **self branches stay outside the gate** on `profiles`
  (`id = auth.uid()`), on `workout_posts` (`author_id = auth.uid()`) and on
  the avatar bucket (own path prefix). Without the first, the client could
  never read back the profile it just created and onboarding would dead-end
  on the "complete your profile" form.
- Deliberately **not** applied to `intro_carousel_content`,
  `onboarding_step_content` or `club_features`: those are the
  pre-redemption onboarding screens themselves, and none carries a
  member-identifying field.
- Auth: **security definer** since 202609060001, and this is load-bearing
  rather than stylistic. The function reads `public.profiles`; as an invoker
  function called from `profiles`' own policy, Postgres refuses with
  "infinite recursion detected in policy for relation profiles". Same reason
  `can_view_profile_field()` next to it is definer. `auth.uid()` is checked
  first and null returns false. Semantics are unchanged: definer rights reach
  the same two rows (the caller's own profile, the caller's own redemption)
  that RLS already returned to their owner.
- pgTAP: `supabase/tests/0067_anonymous_read_gate_test.sql` (the policies) and
  `supabase/tests/0075_definer_read_gate_test.sql` (the definer functions,
  below).
- **The gate is in nine places, not three.** 202609060001 covered the three
  read policies the audit sampled. Re-probing a ghost session against the
  fixed stack — which that migration's own instructions asked for — showed
  the five SECURITY DEFINER read functions still answering in full, because
  a definer function never evaluates a policy and each had re-stated exactly
  one rule: `if auth.uid() is null then raise 'not authorized'`. An anonymous
  session HAS an `auth.uid()`. 202609060009 closed those:
  `feed_page`, `community_search`, `community_profile`, `club_summary` and
  `member_roles`. Plus the `community_streaks` view (202609060002) and the
  `avatar-photos` SELECT policy (202609060003). See the audit section at the
  end of this document.

### are_friends(p_other uuid) returns boolean

- Shipped in 202608280003.
- Purpose: the one definition of "friends" in the schema, a mutual follow
  edge between the caller and `p_other`. There is no friend table.
- Auth: security invoker. Both follows rows are readable to the caller under
  the existing `follows_visible` policy.

## Permissions

### has_perm(p_permission text) returns boolean

- Shipped in 202608280001.
- Purpose: does the caller's club role hold this permission string.
- Auth: security definer, returns false for a null caller. Definer because
  it reads `role_permissions`, and the write policies on the RBAC tables call
  into this chain, which an invoker-rights version would make recursive.
- Notes: `owner` short-circuits to true, so a permission string added by a
  later migration is held by owner with no matching seed row.

### my_permissions() returns setof text

- Shipped in 202608280001.
- Purpose: the caller's full permission set, for the client session cache.
- Auth: security definer, returns an empty set for a caller with no role.

### my_role_code() returns text

- Shipped in 202608280001.
- Purpose: the caller's single effective role code, the highest ranked of
  their `invite_redemptions.role` and the legacy `profiles.is_admin` flag.
- Returns: null when the caller has no live profile or no role at all. Null
  is the correct "not a member" answer and every helper treats it as false.
- Auth: security definer. It takes no user id argument on purpose, so the
  only row it can ever resolve is auth.uid()'s.

### role_rank(p_code text) returns smallint

- Shipped in 202608280001. member 10, coach 20, head_coach 30, staff 40,
  admin 50, owner 60.

### is_staff() returns boolean

- Shipped in 202608270006, reimplemented in 202608280001 as
  `role_rank(my_role_code()) >= 20`. Same signature, so the announcements and
  weekly_challenges policies bound to it stay valid. Same meaning, coach rank
  or above, with one tightening: a soft-deleted profile is no longer staff.

### is_admin() returns boolean

- Shipped in 202608280001. `role_rank(my_role_code()) >= 50`.
- Note: `review_report`, `posts_select_admin_review`, and the four
  `admin_*` RPCs still check the `profiles.is_admin` column inline. Migrating
  those to this function is COMM-150, not a Phase 0 change.

### default_club_id() returns uuid

- Shipped in 202608280001. The seeded single club id, used as the column
  default behind every `club_id`. No table filters on `club_id` today.

## Moderation and admin

### report(p_target_type text, p_target_id uuid, p_reason text, p_note text) returns void

- Shipped in 202608280025, **widened in 202609050002** to admit a `profile`
  target. Supersedes `submit_report(p_post_id, p_reason)`, which stays as a
  thin wrapper. The client calls this by name with all four params, so the
  signature has no defaults. The 202609050002 edit used
  `drop function if exists ...; create function ...`, the convention
  202609030007/202609030008 set for amending an existing RPC, so the grants
  below are re-stated there in full; the signature and return type did not
  change and no caller needs to change.
- Purpose: file a report on a post, a comment, or a member's profile.
- Params: `p_target_type` `post`, `comment` or `profile`, an unknown value
  raises `unknown target type %`. `p_reason` one of harassment, spam,
  inappropriate, privacy, unsafe_advice, other, an unknown value raises.
  `p_note` trimmed to 500 chars, may be empty, stored in `reports.details`.
- Auth: security definer, requires `is_community_member()`. Rate limited at 10
  per 10 minutes under the `report` key. Grant execute to `authenticated`.
- Target validation: a post must exist in `workout_posts`, a comment in
  `post_comments`, a profile in `profiles` **with `deleted_at is null`** — a
  soft-deleted member is not reportable. All three failures raise the same
  `target not found`.
- Side effects: one `reports` row. For a `post` target `post_id` is set equal
  to `target_id`; a `comment` **or `profile`** target leaves `post_id` null,
  which is what keeps the `reports.post_id`-keyed reporter self-hide in
  `feed_page` correct. A duplicate by the
  same reporter on the same target collapses on the unique
  `(reporter_id, target_type, target_id)`, refreshing `reason` and `details`
  without moving the distinct-reporter count and without reopening `status`.
- Second side effect, added 202609050003: the AFTER INSERT trigger
  `reports_notify_moderators` notifies the club's moderators. It fires only on
  a genuinely new row — the `on conflict do update` path above fires UPDATE
  triggers, not INSERT ones, so refreshing a duplicate report is silent.
- Self-reporting a profile is possible and deliberately not special-cased:
  `report()` has never checked self-targeting for posts or comments either, and
  the unique key collapses it to one row.
- The client also records `feed_record_interaction(p_target_id, 'hide',
  <current feed session id>)` when the target is a post (COMM-151). A comment
  or a profile records nothing. The third argument became required in
  202609060010; a `hide` flips neither flag, so the only thing it changes here
  is that the call must carry the key to resolve at all.

### mod_queue(p_status text, p_cursor timestamptz, p_limit int) returns setof mod_queue_item

- Shipped in 202608280025, with the composite type `public.mod_queue_item`
  (`report_id uuid, target_type text, target_id uuid, content_excerpt text,
  content_author_id uuid, content_author_name text, reporter_count integer,
  reasons text[], latest_reason text, note text, status text, created_at
  timestamptz, reporters jsonb`).
- Purpose: the moderation review queue, one row per reported item, grouped by
  `(target_type, target_id)`.
- Params: `p_status` open, reviewing, action_taken, dismissed, or all.
  `p_limit` clamped to 1..50. `p_cursor` pages by the group's earliest
  `created_at`.
- `report_id` is the earliest report in the group, a stable id for it.
  `status` is the group status: open if any report is open, else reviewing,
  else dismissed, else action_taken. `note` is the most recent non-empty
  reporter note. `content_excerpt` is the post or comment body, first 240
  chars, empty when the content is gone. `reporters` is `[{id, name}]`.
- **202609050002**: a third `target_type`, `profile`. `content_excerpt` is then
  the reported member's display name (or `@handle`) followed by their bio on a
  second line, and `content_author_id` / `content_author_name` are the reported
  member themselves — a profile is its own author, so the client's existing
  "act on this member" controls work with no render-side special case. The post
  and comment arms are byte-identical to 202608280025; only the two `case`
  expressions grew an arm, so signature, return type and grants are unchanged
  (`create or replace`).
- Auth: security definer, requires `has_perm('community.comment.moderate')` OR
  real `is_admin`. Grant execute to `authenticated`; the permission check
  inside is the gate. Reporter identities are only ever returned here.

### mod_review(p_report_id uuid, p_decision text, p_note text, p_expires_at timestamptz default null) returns void

- Shipped in 202608280025. Four-argument. `p_expires_at` is read only for
  `p_decision = 'restrict_temp'`; every other decision ignores it. The client
  sends it only for `restrict_temp`.
- Purpose: record a trusted status transition and apply the decision.
- Params: `p_decision` one of remove, warn, restrict_temp, restrict_permanent,
  dismiss. `p_note` up to 500 chars.
- Auth: security definer, `has_perm('community.comment.moderate')` OR real
  `is_admin`, matching `mod_queue`. Grant execute to `authenticated`.
- Side effects, per decision:
  - `remove`: a post target calls `post_delete(target_id)`, a comment target
    calls `comment_moderate(target_id, 'remove')`. Each writes its own
    `content_delete` `admin_actions` row, so a remove leaves two audit rows.
    A **`profile` target raises `a profile report has no content to remove`**
    (202609050002) — there is nothing to take down, and refusing by name beats
    the misleading `comment not found` the untouched two-way `case` would have
    produced.
  - `restrict_temp` / `restrict_permanent`: calls
    `mod_restrict_member(content_author_id, 'temporary' | 'permanent',
    p_expires_at | null, p_note, p_report_id)`, which writes its own
    `member_restrict` row. For a `profile` target the "content author" is the
    reported member themselves (202609050002), resolved through `profiles` with
    `deleted_at is null`, so these are the decisions a profile report actually
    has. Raises if the content author is gone. Note the
    restrict decisions need `community.member.restrict`, which a
    `community.comment.moderate`-only role does not hold, so a coach can pick
    them but the call raises.
  - `warn`, `dismiss`: no content or member change.
- Every decision stamps every `reports` row for `(target_type, target_id)`
  with `reviewed_by`, `reviewed_at`, `review_note = left(p_note, 500)`, sets
  `status` to `dismissed` for `dismiss` and `action_taken` otherwise, and
  writes one `report_review` `admin_actions` row with `before_data` `{status}`
  and `after_data` `{status, decision}`.

### mod_restrict_member(p_user uuid, p_type text, p_expires_at timestamptz, p_reason text, p_report_id uuid) returns uuid

- Shipped in 202608280015. `p_expires_at`, `p_reason`, and `p_report_id`
  default to null, empty string, and null.
- Purpose: the only way to create a posting restriction. Returns the new
  restriction id.
- Params: `p_type` is temporary or permanent. A temporary restriction needs
  `p_expires_at` in the future. A permanent one ignores any expiry passed
  rather than rejecting it, so a UI that always sends its date picker value
  cannot create a row the CHECK refuses. `p_reason` capped at 500 chars.
- Auth: security definer. Requires `community.member.restrict`. Refuses a
  self-restriction and a member with no live profile.
- Side effects: one `posting_restrictions` row plus one `admin_actions` row
  of type `member_restrict`, in the same transaction, so a failed log fails
  the restriction.

### mod_lift_restriction(p_restriction_id uuid, p_reason text) returns void

- Shipped in 202608280015. `p_reason` defaults to an empty string.
- Purpose: end a restriction early. Sets `lifted_at`, `lifted_by`, and
  `lift_reason` rather than deleting the row.
- Auth: security definer. Requires `community.member.restrict`.
- Side effects: one `admin_actions` row of type `member_unrestrict`.
  Idempotent, an already-lifted restriction returns without a second audit
  row.

### is_posting_restricted(p_user uuid) returns boolean

- Shipped in 202608280015. `p_user` defaults to null, which means the
  caller.
- Purpose: the predicate the post insert policy and `add_post_comment` are
  keyed to. True when the member has a restriction that is not lifted and
  either has no expiry or has not expired.
- Auth: security definer, false for a null caller. A caller asking about
  anybody but themselves is refused unless they hold
  `community.member.restrict` or `community.comment.moderate`, so this
  cannot become an "is member X in trouble" oracle for the whole club.
- Notes: expiry is evaluated at read time, not by a scheduled job, so a
  temporary restriction ends on its own with no cron and no backfill.

### log_admin_action(p_action_type text, p_target_type text, p_target_id uuid, p_before jsonb, p_after jsonb, p_action_detail text, p_note text, p_target_user_id uuid) returns void

- Shipped in 202608280002, **widened to eight arguments in 202609060022**
  (five-persona UX audit, defect 2). The five-argument form was `drop
  function`-ed in that migration, so it no longer exists: there must be
  exactly one write path into `admin_actions` and leaving the old one alive
  would leave a path that records no identity. Every existing five-argument
  call site still resolves, because the three new parameters default to
  null and plpgsql resolves a called function by name at runtime.
- All of `p_target_id`, `p_before`, `p_after`, `p_action_detail`, `p_note`
  and `p_target_user_id` default to null.
- Purpose: append one audit row. Called inside the acting function, before it
  returns, so a failed log fails the action.
- Auth: security definer with no grant to anon or authenticated, so it is
  callable only from inside another server function. `admin_id` is taken from
  auth.uid() and never from a parameter, so an audit row cannot be forged for
  someone else. Raises `not authorized` when `auth.uid()` is null.
- **Fills three columns itself, for every caller, old and new.**
  `admin_display` and `target_display` come from `audit_identity_label()` as
  **snapshots at write time**, not joins — `admin_id` has no FK to `profiles`
  precisely so the row outlives the account, and a decision must stay
  defensible under the name its author was actually using.
  `target_user_id` is derived from the target: `target_id` for a `member`,
  the author for a `post` or a `comment`, and for a `report` the reported
  content's author (or the reported member). Null for `club`, `challenge`,
  `invite` and `onboarding_step` targets, which have no member behind them —
  inventing one would be worse than leaving it null.
  `p_target_user_id` is an **override**, not a requirement: a caller that
  already holds the affected member passes it and saves the lookup. Callers
  that must pass it are the ones whose target is gone by the time the log
  line runs — `mod_review` on a `remove` decision, and `post_delete`.
- `p_action_detail` is trimmed to 80 and `p_note` to 1000; both are stored as
  null when empty.
- Side effects: inserts `admin_actions`. The table has no insert, update, or
  delete policy and no write grant, which is what makes it append-only for
  every client including an admin. `p_before` and `p_after` are capped at
  8 KB each inside this function rather than by a CHECK, because
  `pg_column_size()` is STABLE and Postgres refuses a non-IMMUTABLE function
  in a check constraint.

### audit_identity_label(p_user uuid) returns text — PRIVATE, granted to no role

- Shipped in 202609060022. `stable security definer`, and **revoked from
  `public`, `anon` and `authenticated` alike**. One member id to one human
  label: `display_name`, else `@handle`, else null for an unknown or purged
  account — the same order `mod_queue`'s `content_author_name` and the roster
  use, so the audit screen and the moderation queue cannot name one member
  two ways.
- Definer so it resolves past `profiles_read_authenticated` (a soft-deleted
  or blocked admin must still be nameable inside the log), which is exactly
  why it must never be callable directly: granted to `authenticated` it would
  be a uuid-to-display-name oracle over the whole club, blocks and
  `visible_to_club` included. `log_admin_action()` is its only caller.

### admin_actions_page(p_cursor timestamptz, p_limit integer, p_filters jsonb) returns setof admin_actions

- Shipped in 202608280002. Signature and return type **unchanged** by
  202609060022 — it still returns `setof public.admin_actions`, so the five
  columns that migration added simply appear in the rows `cloud.js` already
  receives, and nothing breaks if the client renderer is updated later or
  never.
- Purpose: the admin log view.
- Params: `p_filters` optional {action_type, admin_id, target_user_id}.
  `target_user_id` was added in 202609060022, because the question a review
  actually starts from is "everything ever done to this member" and until
  then the only filters answered "everything this admin did".
  `p_limit` clamped to 1 to 100, default 25.
- Auth: `community.analytics.view`, checked inside the function and again by
  the table's own select policy.

### pin_set(p_target_type text, p_target_id uuid, p_note text) returns void

- Shipped in 202608280017. `p_note` defaults to an empty string, capped at
  200 chars.
- Purpose: pin an item to the club home. `p_target_type` is announcement,
  challenge, event, or post.
- Auth: security definer. Requires `community.content.pin`.
- Raises: `pin_limit_reached` when all three slots are taken, and `pin
  target not found or not pinnable` when the target does not exist, is
  deleted, is a removed post, a cancelled event, or an archived challenge.
- Side effects: one `pins` row in the lowest free slot, plus one
  `admin_actions` row of type `content_pin`. Idempotent, pinning something
  already pinned returns without a second row or a second audit entry.
- Notes: the cap is the unique `(club_id, slot)` with `slot` bounded to 0
  through 2, so it holds under concurrency. `pin_set` takes a transaction
  advisory lock while choosing a slot only so a race surfaces
  `pin_limit_reached` instead of a raw unique violation.

### pin_clear(p_target_type text, p_target_id uuid) returns void

- Shipped in 202608280017.
- Auth: security definer. Requires `community.content.pin`.
- Side effects: deletes the `pins` row and writes an `admin_actions` row of
  type `content_unpin`. Unpinning something already unpinned is a no-op, not
  an error.
- Notes: a target that is deleted, removed, cancelled, or archived is
  unpinned automatically by the `unpin_target()` triggers on
  `workout_posts`, `announcements`, `events`, and `challenges`. Those
  deletes are not audited, because the action that caused them is already in
  the log.

## Needs from schema, admin-moderation

Shipped by schema in 202608280024 and 202608280025. The admin-moderation
cluster (COMM-150 to COMM-156) is now fully backed. `has_perm`,
`my_permissions`, `my_role_code`, `log_admin_action`, `admin_actions_page`,
`mod_restrict_member`, `mod_lift_restriction`, `is_posting_restricted`,
`pin_set` and `pin_clear` were already shipped and are used as documented
above. `report`, `mod_queue`, `mod_review`, `post_delete` and
`comment_moderate` are documented under "Moderation and admin" and "Posts";
this section records the table and enum changes and the two remaining notes.

### reports table changes (202608280024)

- `target_type text not null default 'post'` with a CHECK of `post`,
  `comment`, and `target_id uuid not null` (backfilled from `post_id` for the
  existing rows). `post_id` loses its NOT NULL and stays populated for a
  `post` target (equal to `target_id`); a `comment` target leaves it null.
- The `reason` CHECK gains `unsafe_advice`.
- Unique `(reporter_id, target_type, target_id)` replaces the old
  `(reporter_id, post_id)`.
- `review_note text not null default ''` (<= 500 chars) for the reviewer note
  `mod_review` writes. It is separate from `details`, which is the reporter's
  own note that `report()` writes.
- `report_status` gains `action_taken`. `resolved` stays in the enum for the
  older `review_report` path and no row was remapped.
- The `posts_feed_select` policy edit in the old draft does not apply: that
  policy carries no reports predicate (it was rebuilt without one in
  202608280005). The reporter self-hide lives in `feed_page` (202608280019)
  and the two legacy feed views, all keyed to `reports.post_id`, and because
  `post_id` stays populated for a post report and null for a comment report,
  they keep working with no change - a comment report correctly does not hide
  the post it sits on.

### submit_report(p_post_id uuid, p_reason text default 'inappropriate') returns void

- Rewritten in 202608280025 as a thin wrapper that calls
  `report('post', p_post_id, p_reason, '')`, so the old two-argument shape
  keeps resolving. `cloud.js` no longer calls it.

### comment_moderate(p_comment_id uuid, p_action text) returns void

- Shipped in 202608280025. The comment equivalent of a moderator
  `post_delete`. `post_comments` has no UPDATE grant, so this is the only
  moderator path to a comment's `status`.
- `p_action` one of `remove`, `restore`, an unknown value raises.
- Auth: security definer. `has_perm('community.comment.moderate')` OR real
  `is_admin`. Grant execute to `authenticated`.
- Side effects: `remove` sets `status = 'removed'`, `deleted_at = now()`, and
  `deleted_by = auth.uid()` (the mirror of `comment_delete` stamping the
  author); `restore` clears all three. Each writes one `content_delete`
  `admin_actions` row (target_type `comment`) with before and after status.
  Idempotent: an already-removed comment returns before touching `deleted_by`,
  so a moderator removal is never overwritten by a later restore-then-remove
  race, and vice versa.
- In Phase 1 the client calls this only through `mod_review`'s `remove`
  decision on a comment target, never directly.

### admin_grant_coach(p_user_id uuid, p_role text) returns void

- Shipped in 202608280025. `p_role` carries no default: a default would make
  `admin_grant_coach(uuid)` ambiguous against the one-argument overload and
  every one-argument call would fail. The one-argument
  `admin_grant_coach(p_user_id)` from 202608270011 stays as the "grant coach"
  shorthand and now delegates here, so it audits too. The two-argument form
  accepts `p_role` in `coach` and `head_coach` only; `staff`, `owner`, and any
  other value raise.
- Auth unchanged: real `is_admin` inline, not `is_staff()`.
- Side effect (COMM-154): one `role_change` `admin_actions` row, target_type
  `member`, `before_data` `{role: <prior invite_redemptions.role>}`,
  `after_data` `{role: <granted>}`. `admin_revoke_coach` was rewritten the
  same way, `after_data` `{role: 'member'}`, and returns without an audit row
  when the target was already `member` or had no redemption.
- The `head_coach` -> permission mapping is already in 202608280001
  `role_permissions` (coach set plus `community.post.delete_any`,
  `community.member.restrict`, `community.content.pin`). Nothing to add.

### my_permissions() returns setof text

- Shipped in 202608280001, no change. The client calls it once per session
  into a cached set (`state.permissions`), reads it through `hasPerm()`, and
  drops it on sign-out. It is reloaded on the auth-state-change path so a
  role change takes effect without a reload.

## Needs from schema, admin-moderation (Phase 2)

Schema the Phase 2 admin-moderation ticket (COMM-218) needs. Shipped by
schema in 202608290010, together with the COMM-219 half under "Needs from
schema, notifications (Phase 2)".

### announcements priority and expiry (202608290010)

- `announcements.priority text not null default 'normal' check (priority in
  ('normal', 'important', 'urgent'))`, the client-facing replacement for the
  boolean `important` added in 202608280026. Existing rows with `important`
  set were backfilled to `important` tier in the same migration.
- `announcements.important` was NOT dropped. It stays a real, writable
  boolean kept as an exact mirror of `priority <> 'normal'` by the
  `announcements_priority_sync` BEFORE trigger (documented under "##
  Notifications"), which is the "equivalent trigger-maintained mirror" this
  list allowed. A generated column was rejected: it would make `insert into
  announcements (..., important)` and `update ... set important = true` hard
  errors, and both are live in the shipped pgTAP suite and in any client
  build predating the priority field. Every Phase 1 trigger and policy that
  reads `important` is unchanged.
- `announcements.expires_at timestamptz`, nullable, plus a partial index on
  the rows that carry one. `now()` is not immutable, so "not yet expired"
  cannot be a partial index predicate and is not one.
- Expiry is enforced at read time in RLS, not in a page function: members
  read `announcements` directly, so `announcements_read` became `deleted_at
  is null and (expires_at is null or expires_at > now() or
  public.is_staff())`. That is what drops an expired announcement out of the
  feed top area and the pinned strip with no cron and no backfill, the same
  shape `is_posting_restricted` uses for a timed-out restriction. Staff keep
  reading expired rows, so an admin audit read still shows the record;
  expiry hides an announcement from members, not from the record. This is
  the only policy change in the migration and it is strictly narrower - no
  policy was widened.
- The write gate is untouched. `announcements_insert_admin` /
  `announcements_update_admin` are whole-row `public.is_staff()` policies,
  so both new columns are staff-only to write from the moment they exist.
- Pins are untouched (COMM-155). `pins_unpin_dead_announcement` still fires
  only on `deleted_at`, so an expired-but-pinned announcement stays pinned
  until a staff member explicitly unpins it; it simply stops being readable
  by members, which is what empties it out of the strip.
- Also in this migration, for the fan-out's already-notified test and
  `notif_create`'s own de-dupe probe: `notifications_source_idx` on
  `notifications(source_id, user_id) where source_id is not null`.

## Needs from schema, coach-tools

Schema the Phase 2 coach dashboard (COMM-223 to COMM-226) needs. Shipped by
schema in 202608290013; the three subsections below record what actually
landed, and where it differs from the ask stated here. Nothing in that
migration touches `coach_engagement_flags` (COMM-011): it ships empty in
Phase 2 too, per COMM-226, and is out of scope until COMM-304.

- `coach_celebrate_feed(p_days int default 7) returns setof jsonb`
  (COMM-223, COMM-225). Staff-only (`is_staff()` inline, raises otherwise).
  One call for the whole Celebrate list: recent PRs (from `workout_posts`
  where `post_type = 'POST_PR'` and `created_at` within `p_days`),
  anniversaries (a member whose `invite_redemptions.redeemed_at` hits a
  year multiple within `p_days`, reusing the same tenure arithmetic
  `ach_claim`'s `anniversary_year_*` check already established), and
  challenge completions (`challenge_participants.completed_at` within
  `p_days`). Each row is included only when it would already be visible to
  the calling coach under the normal per-field privacy toggle for its kind
  (`show_prs` for a PR) — Celebrate does not bypass a member's own privacy
  choice, it surfaces what a coach could already see. No birthday source: no
  birth date column exists, per the 2026-08-28 decision, so Celebrate never
  queries for one.
- `profiles.assigned_coach_id uuid references profiles(id) on delete set
  null`, nullable, staff-writable only (COMM-224 "Assign coach optional").
  No policy change needed beyond an update grant already open to
  `authenticated`; the write is gated the same way every other
  member-affecting toggle is, by checking `is_staff()` in the client path,
  and a narrower update policy can be added later without changing this
  column's shape.
- `member_contact_log` table (COMM-224 "Mark contacted"): `id uuid, user_id
  uuid, contacted_by uuid, contacted_at timestamptz default now(), note text
  default ''`. Staff read and write about any member. Unlike
  `coach_engagement_flags` this carries no `user_id <> auth.uid()`
  requirement — being welcomed is not a sensitive signal the way a decline
  flag is — but it is also not surfaced to the member in this ticket's
  scope, since coach-tools.md does not ask for that and it is simpler to add
  visibility later than to remove it.

### coach_celebrate_feed(p_days int default 7) returns setof jsonb (202608290013)

- Purpose: the whole COMM-223 Celebrate list in one call, and the source of
  the items COMM-225's Congratulate action acts on.
- Params: `p_days integer`, default 7, clamped to 1..30 rather than
  rejected; null falls back to 7. Anything outside the range is silently
  clamped, because a bad number here is a client bug and not something worth
  an error toast in front of a coach.
- Returns: `setof jsonb`, newest first, capped at 100 rows. Each row is a
  flat, self-describing object, no joins to make on the client:
  `{ kind, user_id, handle, display_name, avatar_url, occurred_at, post_id,
  detail }`.
  - `kind` is `'pr'`, `'anniversary'`, or `'challenge_completion'`.
  - `occurred_at` is the PR's `created_at`, the anniversary crossing
    (`redeemed_at + threshold days`), or `completed_at`.
  - `post_id` is the source post, and is null exactly when there is none.
    That is the flag COMM-225 branches on: non-null takes
    `add_post_comment`, null takes `post_create`.
  - `detail` is kind-shaped: `{movement, result}` for a PR (read from
    `metadata->>'movement'` / `metadata->>'new_result'`, falling back to
    `title` / `result_text`), `{code, title, years}` for an anniversary
    (`years` is a plain integer, not the numeric threshold), and
    `{challenge_id, title}` for a completion.
- Auth: SECURITY DEFINER, `auth.uid()` checked first, then `is_staff()`
  inline. Both failures raise `not authorized` (P0001), so a non-staff or
  unauthenticated caller is refused by the database and not only by a hidden
  nav item. Executable by `authenticated` only.
- Privacy: every row is subject to the subject member's own toggle, resolved
  through `can_view_profile_field()` — `show_prs` for a PR (plus
  `post_visible_to_viewer()` for the post's own followers/friends/block
  rules), `in_leaderboards` for a completion, `visible_to_club` for an
  anniversary. There is no anniversary-specific toggle and none was
  invented. A deleted profile, and a member on either side of a block edge,
  drop out. Celebrate surfaces what a coach could already see; it never
  bypasses a member's choice.
- Anniversaries reuse `ach_claim`'s tenure arithmetic exactly
  (202608290002): any enabled `achievement_definitions` row with
  `config->>'metric' = 'tenure_days'` and `threshold >= 365`, tested against
  `invite_redemptions.redeemed_at`, plus one window bound. A tenure
  definition added later is picked up with no further migration, and the day
  an anniversary appears here is the day `ach_claim` grants the badge.
- No birthday source is queried, and none exists to query.
- Side effects: none, the function is `stable`. No rate limit: it is a
  dashboard read by a staff-only caller.

### profiles.assigned_coach_id + coach_assign_coach (202608290013)

- `profiles.assigned_coach_id uuid references public.profiles(id) on delete
  set null`, nullable, with a partial index on the non-null rows. A coach
  leaving the club nulls their members' assignments rather than taking the
  rows with them.
- Correction to the ask above: "no policy change needed beyond the update
  grant already open to `authenticated`" was not true on this schema.
  `profiles` has exactly one UPDATE policy, `profiles_update_self`
  (202608270003), and it is `id = auth.uid()` on both sides — a coach's
  direct UPDATE of another member's row does not fail, it silently matches
  zero rows, which would have made "Assign coach" a button that appears to
  work and does nothing.
- Rather than widen the `profiles` UPDATE policy — which would let any coach
  rewrite any member's handle, display name, and every privacy toggle, and
  which is identity-privacy's call rather than a side effect of the coach
  dashboard — the migration crosses the boundary once, on purpose, in a
  function that can touch only this column:
  `coach_assign_coach(p_user_id uuid, p_coach_id uuid default null) returns
  uuid`.
  - Purpose: COMM-224 "Assign coach (optional)". Sets
    `profiles.assigned_coach_id` for `p_user_id`, or clears it when
    `p_coach_id` is null (so unassign needs no second function).
  - Returns the value written, i.e. `p_coach_id`.
  - Auth: SECURITY DEFINER, `auth.uid()` first, then `is_staff()` inline.
    Raises `not authorized` (P0001) otherwise. Executable by
    `authenticated` only.
  - Also raises: `member required` on a null `p_user_id`, `member not found`
    when the target does not exist or is deleted, and `assigned coach must
    be staff` when `p_coach_id` is not itself admin or rank >= 20 — the
    field means "which coach owns this relationship", so pointing it at a
    plain member would make every dashboard reading it lie.
  - Side effects: one UPDATE of one column on one row. No notification, no
    audit row, no analytics.
- `protect_is_admin()` (the existing BEFORE UPDATE trigger on `profiles`)
  now also pins `assigned_coach_id`, alongside `is_admin`, `club_id`, and
  `recovery_verified_at`. Without it a member could set their own assigned
  coach through the existing own-row update, and a field a member can set
  about themselves is not a coach assignment. The pin is lifted for exactly
  one statement by the transaction-local `app.allow_coach_assign` GUC, the
  same escape hatch `mark_recovery_verified()` uses and for the same reason:
  `auth.role()` still reads `authenticated` inside a definer function.
- Still open, for identity-privacy: `profiles_insert_self` does not require
  `assigned_coach_id is null`, so a member's first profile insert could
  carry a value. Closing that is a one-clause policy change on `profiles`
  and is left to identity-privacy rather than taken here. The narrower
  staff UPDATE policy the ask anticipates can also still replace
  `coach_assign_coach` later without changing the column's shape.

### member_contact_log (202608290013)

- Columns exactly as asked: `id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid()`,
  `user_id uuid not null references profiles(id) on delete cascade`,
  `contacted_by uuid not null default auth.uid() references profiles(id) on
  delete cascade`, `contacted_at timestamptz not null default now()`, `note
  text not null default '' check (char_length(note) <= 500)`. Indexed on
  `(user_id, contacted_at desc)` and `(contacted_by, contacted_at desc)`.
  No `club_id`: the contract named five columns and this is the shape the
  client gets from `select *`.
- The client inserts `{user_id, note}` and never names itself —
  `contacted_by` defaults to `auth.uid()`.
- RLS, four policies:
  - `member_contact_log_staff_select`: `is_staff()`. Every staff member
    reads every row, which is what makes it coordination rather than a
    private note.
  - `member_contact_log_staff_insert`: `is_staff() and contacted_by =
    auth.uid()`. The same author pin every other insert policy in this
    schema carries; staff cannot log contact in another coach's name.
  - `member_contact_log_author_update` / `..._author_delete`: `is_staff()
    and contacted_by = auth.uid()`. Correcting or withdrawing an entry is
    the author's to do.
- No `user_id <> auth.uid()` clause anywhere, deliberately, and that is the
  one line where this table differs from `coach_engagement_flags`: a staff
  member may log contact with themselves here. Being welcomed is not a
  decline flag.
- Not member-readable in this ticket's scope: a plain member reads nothing,
  including the row about themselves. Adding a member-facing SELECT policy
  later is one line; removing a leak is not.
- `anon` has no grant on the table at all.

## Analytics

### analytics_track(event_name, props)

- Client helper, not an RPC. Direct RLS insert into `analytics_events` with
  own-row insert and analytics-holder read. `event_name` must be one of the
  defined constants. `props` under 4 KB. Adding a prop is additive, removing
  or renaming bumps `schema_version`.
- Shipped in `src/analytics.js` as `window.analyticsTrack`, see the client
  platform helpers section below for the finalised signature.

## Client platform helpers

Shipped by platform in Phase 0, COMM-012 through COMM-015. These are not
RPCs. They are plain classic scripts under `src/`, loaded by `index.html`
before `cloud.js` and `app.js`, precached in `sw.js`, and reached through
`window`. A new file here has to be added to `index.html`, the `sw.js`
`REQUIRED_ASSETS` list, and `test/helpers/boot.mjs` in the same order, or it
is either missing offline or invisible to every test.

### window.HaimuniaEvents, COMM-012

`src/eventbus.js`. The one product event interface. Feature code never
reaches another feature's internals to learn that something happened.

- `EVENTS` frozen map of the eleven typed events. Also aliased as
  `window.PRODUCT_EVENTS`. Each constant's value is its own name.
- `emit(type, payload)` returns the number of handlers invoked, 0 when the
  event was dropped. Synchronous dispatch, no await, no deep clone. A
  producer never waits on a consumer.
- `on(type, handler)` returns an unsubscribe function. Calling it twice is a
  no-op and never removes another handler.
- `reset()` drops every subscription. `handlerCount(type)` for
  introspection.
- Unknown type: throws in development, warns and drops in production.
  Development means `window.HAIMUNIA_DEV === true`, or a localhost origin.
- Payload must be a plain object. Omitting it delivers `{}`.
- Handlers are isolated. One throwing handler does not stop the rest, and a
  rejected promise from an async handler is caught and logged.
- Phase 0 ships zero producers and zero consumers. ATTENDANCE_RECORDED is
  defined and accepted with no producer, so wiring attendance later touches
  no other file. COMM-300 (Phase 3) gave it one — `flushOutbox()` in
  cloud.js, payload `{occurred_on}` — and the prediction held: `eventbus.js`
  needed no change beyond its own comment. A consumer must not assume the
  emit is authoritative; `attendance_log` is written server-side by a trigger,
  independently, so an older cached build produces the row without the event.

### window.HaimuniaAnalytics, COMM-013

`src/analytics.js`. The only writer of `analytics_events`.

- `track(eventName, props)`, aliased as `window.analyticsTrack`. Returns a
  promise resolving true when the row was accepted. It never throws and
  never rejects: a dropped analytics row is acceptable, a broken button is
  not. Every call site may ignore the result.
- `EVENTS` frozen map of the tracked names from spec section 77: the 21
  Phase 1 names, plus `search_performed`, `push_opt_in`,
  `coach_congratulate_sent` and `directory_opened` from COMM-233, plus
  `attendance_recorded` from COMM-300. Also
  aliased as `window.ANALYTICS_EVENTS`. An unknown name is warned and
  dropped, it never reaches the table. COMM-233's `recap_viewed` and
  `recap_shared` are the already-reserved `weekly_recap_opened` and
  `weekly_recap_shared`, wired rather than renamed.
- `props` is trimmed, not rejected. Over `PROPS_BUDGET_BYTES` the largest
  values are dropped first and `_truncated: true` is added. The budget is
  3 KB rather than the server's 4 KB because the trigger measures
  `pg_column_size()` on stored jsonb, which is not the length of the JSON
  text the client sends.
- `SCHEMA_VERSION` is 1. Adding a prop is additive. Removing or renaming a
  prop, or changing what one means, bumps it.
- `configure({ client, userId | getUserId, attachToBus, debug })` hands the
  helper a Supabase client and a way to read the current user id, and
  attaches the bus bridge unless `attachToBus` is false. An unconfigured
  `track()` is an inert no-op that touches no network, which is why COMM-170
  calls it at the head of the session-ready path in `cloud.js`
  (`refreshSession` and `onAuthStateChange`) rather than the tail. `getUserId`
  is a getter over `state.user`, so one call covers every later sign-out and
  sign-in.
- The dev switch: `window.HAIMUNIA_ANALYTICS_DEBUG = true`, or
  `configure({ debug: true })`. Every event is logged to the console and
  nothing is written. The global wins over the configure option so it can be
  flipped on a device that is already running. `isDebug()` reports the state.
- `BUS_EVENT_MAP` is the one-to-one product-event to analytics-name map:
  POST_CREATED, COMMENT_CREATED, REACTION_CREATED, CHALLENGE_JOINED,
  CHALLENGE_COMPLETED, EVENT_REGISTERED, and ATTENDANCE_RECORDED from
  COMM-300. WORKOUT_COMPLETED, PR_CREATED, MEMBER_JOINED and
  ACHIEVEMENT_UNLOCKED are deliberately unmapped: completing a workout is not
  sharing one, and unlocking an achievement is not sharing it.
  ATTENDANCE_RECORDED was unmapped for a different reason until Phase 3 — it
  had no producer at all — and unlike WORKOUT_COMPLETED it is deduplicated to
  one emit per member per calendar day, which is what makes it genuinely
  one-to-one rather than a per-set firehose.
- `BUS_PROP_KEYS` is the per-event prop allow-list the bridge projects each
  payload through, with `projectBusPayload(productEvent, payload)` doing the
  work. A bus payload is built for its consumers, not for this table, so a
  key that is not on the list is dropped and an array prop is stored as its
  length (`mentions` becomes `mention_count`). That is what keeps the props
  shape a stable contract and keeps member-authored text out of analytics.
  A feature agent never hand-tracks one of the seven bridged names: the bridge
  already wrote the row, and a second call would double count.
- `HAND_PROP_KEYS` (COMM-233) is the same allow-list for the hand-tracked
  Phase 2 names, applied by `track()` itself through
  `projectHandProps(eventName, props)`. A key not on the list is dropped
  before the row is built, so no call site can attach challenge rules text,
  a recap sentence or the search query. Phase 1 names have no entry and pass
  their props through unchanged.
- `ACTIVE_MEMBER_EVENTS` and `isActiveMemberEvent(name)` are the qualifying
  subset for Weekly Community Active Members, spec section 78. COMM-233
  reviewed every Phase 2 name against it explicitly:
  `coach_congratulate_sent` (for the coach) and `weekly_recap_shared` count;
  `leaderboard_viewed`, `weekly_recap_opened`, `search_performed`,
  `directory_opened` and `push_opt_in` do not.
- `docs/community/metrics.md` is the metrics contract: the WCAM definition,
  every tracked event with its trigger surface and props, the core and
  additional metrics, and what is deliberately unwired. A feature agent that
  adds a surface adds its row there in the same change.

### window.HaimuniaRealtime, COMM-014

`src/realtime.js`. One subscription helper and one registry. Feature code
never calls `client.channel()` directly.

- `configure({ client })` hands it the Supabase client.
- `subscribe(channelName, opts, handler)` returns an unsubscribe function,
  always, so a caller never needs a null check. `opts` is
  `{ table, event, schema, filter }` for postgres_changes, or
  `{ broadcast }` or `{ presence }`. Defaults are every event on the public
  schema.
- `unsubscribe(name)`, `teardownAll()` which returns how many were closed,
  `count()` and `list()`.
- One channel per name. A repeat subscribe under the same name replaces the
  binding rather than stacking a second one.
- Handlers are bound before `subscribe()` is called, which is what makes
  reconnect safe. Nothing re-binds on a status callback, so a rejoin after a
  dropped socket cannot duplicate handlers. A terminal CLOSED drops the
  registry slot.
- `MAX_SUBSCRIPTIONS` is 10. The eleventh warns and closes the oldest.
- `cloud.js` calls `teardownAll()` from `setCommunityTab` on a real tab
  change. That is the only cloud.js line COMM-014 touches.
- With no configured client, subscribe is a working no-op. Phase 0 opens
  zero subscriptions. Realtime replication per table is a Phase 2 schema
  change under COMM-227 and COMM-209.

### window.HaimuniaImage, COMM-015

`src/image.js`. Everything that reaches Storage goes through this first.

- `prepareImage(file, opts)` resolves to
  `{ type, source, render, thumbnail, thumbnails }`. `render` is capped at
  1600 px on the long edge, `thumbnails` are 400 px and 200 px, and
  `thumbnail` is the 400 px entry. Each is drawn from the one decoded
  bitmap, so a thumbnail is never a re-compression of the render.
- Rejects with an `Error` carrying `.code`: `not_an_image`,
  `file_too_large`, `decode_failed`, `encode_failed`, `image_too_large`.
  The composer maps `not_an_image` to "This file is not an image" and
  everything else to "This image could not be processed".
- Input over 25 MB is refused before any decode. Output targets 400 KB at
  quality 0.8, steps down by 0.1 to a floor of 0.5, and past the 1 MB hard
  cap drops to 0.4 once and then rejects.
- Output type is WebP where supported, otherwise JPEG. Both are inside the
  `post-photos` bucket allow-list, which also caps one object at 5 MB
  (migration 202608270004).
- EXIF orientation is applied on decode with
  `createImageBitmap(file, { imageOrientation: "from-image" })`. The canvas
  re-encode is what strips every other tag, GPS included. That is a privacy
  property, so the helper never passes the original File through untouched
  even when it is already small enough.
- `checkByteBudget({ usedBytes, addedBytes, budgetBytes })` is the
  aggregate per-account check for the photo quota work. It answers
  `{ ok, remainingBytes, overBy, ... }` and reads its numbers from the
  caller: the quota is object-count based today (202608270006) and a
  byte-budget column is a later schema ticket.
- `opts.backend` swaps the decode, canvas and encode seam. It is how the
  tests run without a canvas, and how a later ticket would move the work
  into a worker without rewriting `prepareImage`.
- Nothing is wired to it in Phase 0. posts consumes it in COMM-103.

## Realtime and search

### Realtime publication membership (COMM-209, COMM-227)

- Shipped in 202608290007.
- `alter publication supabase_realtime add table public.<name>;`, one
  statement per table, for `challenge_progress`, `challenge_participants`
  (COMM-209), and `post_comments`, `reactions`, `notifications` (COMM-227).
  `HaimuniaRealtime` (COMM-014) has subscribed to all five since Phase 1
  with zero replication enabled; this migration is the one-line-per-table
  flip that turns each of those existing no-op subscriptions live, with no
  RLS or grant change of its own - `postgres_changes` payloads are still
  filtered per-subscriber by each table's existing row level security, the
  same as any other read. `notifications` closes the specific gap COMM-140
  already logged ("no-op until COMM-227").
- `ALTER PUBLICATION ... ADD TABLE` is transactional DDL (unlike `CREATE
  INDEX CONCURRENTLY` or `ALTER TYPE ... ADD VALUE`), so it runs inside the
  usual `begin; ... commit;` migration block with no special handling.
  Confirmed via `supabase db reset` plus `select * from
  pg_publication_tables where pubname = 'supabase_realtime'` returning all
  five rows afterward.

### Client channel inventory (COMM-209, COMM-227)

- The client half, in `cloud.js`, on top of 202608290007. Correcting one
  line above: only the own-row `notifications` channel existed before this
  cluster (COMM-140 wired it early); the other four channels are new here.
  Every one of them is opened through `HaimuniaRealtime.subscribe()` and
  never by reaching past the harness to the client, so one `teardownAll()`
  closes all of them.
- Channels, all `postgres_changes`:
  - `chal-progress-<id>`: `challenge_progress` INSERT,
    `challenge_id=eq.<id>`. Open only while a challenge detail is open.
  - `chal-participants-<id>`: `challenge_participants` UPDATE, same filter.
  - `feed-comments`: `post_comments` INSERT, unfiltered.
  - `feed-reactions`: `reactions` `*`, unfiltered.
  - `notif-<uid>`: `notifications` `*`, `user_id=eq.<uid>`.
- The two feed channels are shared per feed session rather than one per
  card: `postgres_changes` filters are `eq`-only, a feed page is twenty
  posts, and `MAX_SUBSCRIPTIONS` is 10. Incoming rows are filtered client
  side against the currently rendered post ids (`findFeedPost`), so an
  event for a post that is not on screen costs nothing.
- Every handler re-fetches through the surface's existing load path
  (`chal_progress`, `loadCommentsFor`, `loadReactionsFor`) instead of
  applying the payload row. A `postgres_changes` payload is one raw table
  row: no profile join, no block filtering, no server-side aggregation.
  Applying it directly would render something a manual refresh of the same
  screen would not.
- Every re-fetch is debounced (400 ms, keyed per challenge or per post), so
  a burst of rows costs one query rather than one per row. Pending timers
  are cancelled by the same teardown that closes the channels, so a timer
  cannot fire into a view that is gone.
- Teardown points: `setCommunityTab` (which also closes an open challenge
  detail, since the detail belongs to the view that opened it),
  `closeChallengeView`, and sign-out. Arming is idempotent and happens in
  `afterRenderCommunity`, which checks the registry rather than a local
  flag, so a channel closed by a teardown re-opens on the next render of a
  view that still wants it.
- With no configured client, or with the channel unreachable, `subscribe()`
  returns a working no-op and every surface stays on its existing
  poll-on-open behavior. No surface shows an error for a missing channel.
- Not realtime in V1, deliberately: new feed cards (the feed refreshes on
  open, pull and paginate), and urgent announcements, whose broadcast path
  is still COMM-219.

### community_search(p_query text, p_limit int default 10) returns jsonb

- Shipped in 202608290008.
- Purpose: one round trip returning `{members: [...], events: [...],
  challenges: [...]}` for a grouped search UI (COMM-228), instead of three.
- Auth: security definer, `set search_path = ''`, revoked from `public,
  anon`, granted only to `authenticated`. Raises `not authorized` for a
  null caller before any table is touched. Definer buys exactly one thing:
  crossing the RLS boundary on purpose to union three already-existing
  readable sets server-side (events, challenges) rather than widening what
  any single caller could see one row at a time.
- Sanitization: `p_query` is stripped of `%`, `_`, `,`, `(`, `)` and
  trimmed - the exact same characters `searchPeople` (cloud.js) already
  strips client-side - before it is ever wrapped in an `ilike` pattern.
  Necessary here specifically because this function receives the raw
  string over RPC, not the client's pre-sanitized copy. A stripped query
  under 2 characters returns `{members: [], events: [], challenges: []}`
  immediately, no table read, matching `searchPeople`'s existing
  client-side threshold. `p_limit` is clamped to between 1 and 50
  (`default 10`) and applied per group, not to the total.
- `members`: the exact same shape and visibility `searchPeople` already
  provides - `id, handle, display_name, bio, avatar_url, allow_follows`,
  matched by `ilike` on `handle` or `display_name`, excluding the caller's
  own row, mirroring `profiles_read_authenticated` (202608280003)
  literally: `deleted_at is null`, no `blocks` row between caller and
  target in either direction, and (`visible_to_club` or `is_admin()`).
- `events`: matches `title` `ilike`, mirroring `events_read` (202608280010)
  literally: `status <> 'draft'`, or the caller is `created_by`, or the
  caller holds `community.event.manage`. This is the actual policy
  predicate (any non-draft status, not literally "published only") - the
  function does not invent a looser or stricter rule than the policy it
  mirrors.
- `challenges`: matches `title` `ilike`, mirroring `challenges_read`
  (202608280009) literally: `status <> 'draft'`, or the caller is
  `created_by`, or the caller holds `community.challenge.create`
  (challenges has no separate `.manage` permission - `.create` is the one
  permission that already gates every challenges write and read-widening).
- No full-text search and no post search - members, events, and challenges
  only, per platform.md's explicit V1 exclusion.
- Verified locally via `supabase db reset` plus manual psql smoke tests
  impersonating fixture members through `tests.set_auth()`: a draft
  event/challenge is invisible to a non-creator without the manage/create
  permission and visible to its creator and to a permission holder; a
  club-hidden member (`visible_to_club = false`) and a blocked member are
  both excluded from the members group; a query under 2 characters returns
  all three groups empty with no table read; a query built entirely from
  `%_,()` characters strips to empty rather than wildcard-matching
  everything; `p_limit` caps each group independently. See "Phase 2 schema
  handoff for qa" in `docs/community/backlog.md` for the full boundary
  table, and `test/community-realtime-search-rls.test.mjs` for the static
  assertions.

### Search UI (COMM-228)

- One box (`#communityPeopleSearch`, Account tab), one call per keystroke,
  three labeled groups rendered in a fixed order - members, events,
  challenges - never interleaved: a member row and an event row are not
  comparable, and mixing them would need a cross-type relevance order the
  function deliberately does not compute. Each group carries
  `data-search-group="<members|events|challenges>"`.
- `searchPeople(query)` is kept as the input handler's name and now
  delegates to `communitySearch(query)`. `state.people` still holds the
  members group with the same row shape and the same follow/block/profile
  controls, so the existing caller is unchanged.
- The client strips `%_,()` and trims before checking the 2-character
  threshold, so a query of only those characters is empty results with no
  request. The RPC re-applies both, since it receives the raw string.
- States: under 2 characters is a hint and no request; in flight is
  "מחפש..."; a failed call clears the three groups rather than showing an
  error, matching the members-only search's previous failure behavior. A
  response is dropped if a later keystroke already fired.
- A challenge result opens the real challenge detail
  (`CHALLENGE_VIEWED` with `source: "search"`). An event result records
  `EVENT_VIEWED` with the same source and shows title, start and status
  only - there is no event detail surface until COMM-213, and the row does
  not pretend to navigate to one.

## Needs from schema, platform (Phase 2)

Closed. See "## Realtime and search" above.

## Needs from schema, recaps

Shipped in `202608290011_recaps_and_onboarding.sql`. Covered by
`supabase/tests/0031_recaps_and_onboarding_test.sql`.

**Follow-up from COMM-220, `202608290012_notif_create_service_role.sql`:**
`notif_create()` (202608280026) is `revoke all ... from public, anon,
authenticated`, same as `default_club_id()` originally was. Every caller
until COMM-220 was a trigger owned by the migration owner, which Postgres
checks as an effectively unrestricted role - the missing `service_role`
grant never showed for the same reason `default_club_id()`'s didn't.
`recap_weekly` is the first caller that reaches `notif_create` over
PostgREST as the literal `service_role` role, which does have EXECUTE
checked for real; without this one-line grant every `recap_weekly`
notification call fails `42501` silently (the recap row itself still
lands - see the function's own try/catch). Found and fixed while building
and manually verifying COMM-220 against a fresh local stack; independently
confirmed with `has_function_privilege('service_role', ...)` before and
after.

### weekly_recaps

`id uuid pk`, `user_id uuid not null` → `profiles(id)` cascade, `club_id uuid
not null default default_club_id()`, `week_start date not null`,
`sessions_completed integer not null default 0`, `streak integer not null
default 0`, `prs jsonb not null default '[]'`, `achievements jsonb not null
default '[]'`, `challenge_progress jsonb not null default '[]'`,
`club_challenge_progress jsonb not null default '{}'`, `upcoming_event jsonb`
(nullable — null means no upcoming event), `generated_at timestamptz not null
default now()`, `classmates jsonb not null default '[]'` (202609010003,
COMM-316).

- Unique `weekly_recaps_user_week_key (user_id, week_start)`. This is what
  makes `recap_weekly` idempotent per user per week: upsert with `on conflict
  (user_id, week_start) do update` and a rerun updates in place rather than
  duplicating.
- **`week_start` must be a Monday**, enforced by `check (extract(isodow from
  week_start) = 1)`. `recap_weekly` must key on the ISO week's Monday. A
  free-form date would make the unique key unique per date rather than per
  week, so two runs disagreeing about where the week starts would both
  insert. A non-Monday raises `23514`.
- Own-row select for `authenticated`, and nothing else. There is no insert,
  update, or delete grant or policy for any client, the owning member
  included. Only `recap_weekly`, running as service role (which bypasses
  RLS), writes it. `anon` cannot reach the table at all.
- A quiet week is a real row: the defaults give zeros and empty lists rather
  than nulls, so COMM-221 renders the quiet-week state without guessing.
- `club_challenge_progress` is aggregate club figures only, never a
  per-member breakdown. That rule is unchanged by COMM-316: the classmates
  line names people, the club challenge figure never does.
- `classmates` (202609010003, COMM-316, closing COMM-P06) is
  `[{user_id, display_name, handle, avatar_url}]` — up to a small number of
  members this row's own member shared an `attendance_log` day with during
  `week_start`'s ISO week, ordered by shared days then display name. Four
  keys and no fifth: the shared-day **count** is the ordering key inside
  `recap_weekly_classmates()` and never leaves it. Empty array means no
  overlap **or** the member's own `show_attendance` is off; never null,
  never an error. `recap_weekly` is the only writer, and it gets the value
  from `recap_weekly_classmates()` rather than building it in TypeScript.
- **Why naming individuals is allowed here and nowhere else.** A
  `weekly_recaps` row is a private, own-row surface — `weekly_recaps_self_
  select` is the only policy and there is no write grant at all — so a
  classmates line reaches exactly one member, the one who was in the room on
  the days being named. `monthly_club_recaps` (COMM-309) is the opposite:
  one row the whole club reads, with no `user_id`, `text` or `jsonb` column
  a name could be written into, and it stays aggregate-only forever. Same
  module, two audiences, two rules. Do not copy this column's shape into a
  club-visible table.
- `default_club_id()` is now also granted to `service_role`. `weekly_recaps`
  is the first table a service-role caller writes directly rather than
  through a security definer function, so the `club_id` default is evaluated
  as `service_role`; without the grant every `recap_weekly` insert would fail
  `42501`. `recap_weekly` can therefore omit `club_id` and let the default
  fire.

### onboarding_progress

`user_id uuid primary key` → `auth.users(id)` cascade, `welcomed_at
timestamptz`, `first_week_shown_at timestamptz`, `first_month_shown_at
timestamptz`, `first_class_shown_at timestamptz`, `third_class_shown_at
timestamptz` (the last two 202609010003, COMM-316). Null means "not shown
yet".

- Own-row select and update for `authenticated`. The update is the client
  marking a step seen at render time. No insert grant and no delete grant, so
  a member cannot invent a fresh row — or delete and re-create one — to
  re-see a step.
- The FK is to `auth.users`, not `profiles`, because a redemption lands
  before the profile exists (`profiles_insert_self` requires the redemption
  to already be there).
- **Stamps are one-way.** Trigger `onboarding_progress_pin` (BEFORE UPDATE)
  pins `user_id` and every already-set timestamp to its previous value.
  Clearing or moving a stamp is accepted and silently has no effect rather
  than raising, so a benign double-write from two tabs, or a retry after a
  failed dismiss-write, is a no-op instead of an error on a new member's
  first day. Clients should treat mark-seen as fire-and-forget.
  **`onboarding_progress_pin_shown()` names its columns one at a time** —
  it is deliberately not a generic `to_jsonb(old)`/`to_jsonb(new)` merge,
  which would also pin any non-timestamp column a later ticket adds and turn
  "a shown-stamp is one-way" into "this table is append-only". The cost is
  that **adding a sixth onboarding step requires adding a line to that
  function**; COMM-316 had to add two, and 0047 asserts the one-way rule as
  a sweep over every `timestamptz` column so a forgotten line fails a test
  rather than shipping as a step that silently re-arms itself.
- There is no `joined_at` column here. The onboarding clock runs from
  `invite_redemptions.redeemed_at`, the module's authoritative
  `MEMBER_JOINED` timestamp, which the member can already read on their own
  row and which `ach_claim` already meters the anniversary achievements off.
- The two steps tied to the member's first and third logged training day
  landed in 202609010003 (COMM-316, closing COMM-P07) as
  `first_class_shown_at` and `third_class_shown_at`. The column names say
  "class"; the clock does not, and cannot — see 202609060024 below.
  **Their eligibility is not a column here either**,
  for the same reason there is no `joined_at`: the clock is
  `public.attendance_log`, which the member already reads on their own rows
  under `attendance_log_self_select`. "Do I have at least one row" and "do I
  have at least three distinct `occurred_on` days" are direct client
  queries — no RPC, no view, no denormalised counter. (`attendance_log` is
  unique on `(user_id, occurred_on)`, so three rows are three days.)
- **The five steps are independent and unordered.** There is no ordering
  between any of them anywhere in the schema — five nullable stamps, five
  independent eligibility questions — which is what makes COMM-316's "these
  two steps do not block or reorder the three already-shipped steps" a
  structural fact rather than a client convention.
- **No backfill for the two new columns.** They start null on every existing
  row, which is the correct state both for a brand-new member and for one
  who has already logged fifty classes: that member sees the first-class
  card once, on their next visit. Stamping retroactively would need a rule
  about which past day counted as "shown", and there is no honest one.

### seed_onboarding_progress()

- Trigger function, `security definer`. Fires as
  `invite_redemptions_seed_onboarding`, AFTER INSERT on
  `invite_redemptions`, one row per statement row.
- Purpose: seed exactly one `onboarding_progress` row at `MEMBER_JOINED`.
  `on conflict (user_id) do nothing`.
- Params: none (trigger). Returns: `trigger`.
- Auth rule: revoked from `public`, `anon`, and `authenticated` — not
  callable as an RPC. It carries no `auth.uid()` check by design: it acts on
  the row being inserted, not on the caller, and the real boundary is that no
  client can insert into `invite_redemptions` at all (only
  `redeem_invite_code()` can).
- Side effects: one `onboarding_progress` insert. INSERT-only on purpose —
  `grant_coach_role()` and `grant_coach_role_by_handle()` UPDATE
  `invite_redemptions` and move `redeemed_at`, and firing on those would
  reset onboarding for a member who has already been through it.
- The migration also backfills a row for every pre-existing redemption.

## Needs from schema, new-member post (COMM-107)

### post_new_member_on_join() (202608290014)

- Trigger function, `security definer`. Fires as
  `invite_redemptions_new_member_post`, AFTER INSERT on
  `invite_redemptions`, one row per statement row.
- Params: none (trigger). Returns: `trigger`.
- Purpose: the server-side producer for `POST_NEW_MEMBER`. COMM-107 shipped
  the enum label (202608280004), the nullable `author_id` that exists for it,
  and `renderNewMemberPostCard` in cloud.js back in Phase 1; the INSERT that
  creates the row was never built, which is what made COMM-224's coach
  "Welcome" button inert. This is that INSERT and nothing else.
- Auth rule: revoked from `public`, `anon`, and `authenticated` — not callable
  as an RPC. No `auth.uid()` check, same documented exception as
  `seed_onboarding_progress()`: it acts on the row being inserted, not on the
  caller, and the boundary is that no client can insert into
  `invite_redemptions` at all (only `redeem_invite_code()` can). A member also
  cannot hand-write an equivalent row directly — `posts_insert_self` still
  requires `author_id = auth.uid()`, so an authorless post is unreachable from
  any client key.
- Side effects: exactly one `public.workout_posts` insert, with
  `author_id = null`, `post_type = 'POST_NEW_MEMBER'`, `visibility = 'club'`,
  `status = 'active'`, `club_id = default_club_id()`,
  `source_type = 'member'`, `source_id = <the new member>`,
  `published_at = redeemed_at`, `occurred_on = redeemed_at::date`, and a
  Hebrew `body`. No notification, no profile write, no other table touched.
- `metadata` shape, fixed by the already-shipped renderer and by the fixture
  in `test/community-post-cards.test.mjs`:
  `{member_id: uuid-as-string, member_name: text (optional), joined_on:
  timestamptz-as-string}`. `member_id` is always present and is what
  `findNewMemberPost()` in cloud.js matches on. Nothing else is written into
  `metadata`.
- `member_name` is **optional and usually absent in production**. A redemption
  lands before the profile exists (`profiles_insert_self` requires the
  redemption row), so at trigger time there is normally no `display_name` and
  no `handle` to read. The function looks anyway — `display_name`, falling
  back to `handle` — and omits the key entirely when neither is available,
  rather than storing a placeholder. The client's existing fallback chain
  (`m.member_name || postAuthorName(post) || "חבר/ה חדש/ה"`) is what covers
  the absent case. Filling the name in later would mean a trigger on
  `profiles`, which is identity-privacy's call, not this migration's.
- Idempotency: a guard (`exists` on
  `metadata ->> 'member_id'` where `post_type = 'POST_NEW_MEMBER'`, backed by
  `workout_posts_new_member_metadata_idx`), deliberately not a unique index —
  a unique violation would abort the enclosing redemption and block a real
  person from joining the club over a duplicate feed post.
- INSERT-only, so promoting an existing member (`grant_coach_role()` and
  `grant_coach_role_by_handle()`, both UPDATEs) never re-announces them, and
  the one-arg `redeem_invite_code()`'s `on conflict do update` does not
  either.
- Fires for every redemption regardless of role, including a coach-code
  redemption. Only the promote-an-existing-member path is excluded, and it is
  excluded by the trigger event rather than by a role test.
- `invite_redemptions` now carries two AFTER INSERT ROW triggers, this one and
  `invite_redemptions_seed_onboarding`. Both fire on a single insert and
  neither depends on the other's output; `0033_new_member_post_test.sql`
  asserts both effects from one insert.
- **No backfill.** Unlike `onboarding_progress`, these rows are club-visible
  feed content, so backfilling every existing member would publish one
  arrival announcement per member at once for joins that happened months ago.
  Members who joined before 202608290014 therefore have no welcome post and
  cannot be welcomed through COMM-224; publishing historical welcomes is a
  product decision with a chosen schedule, not a migration side effect.

## Needs from schema, attendance (COMM-300, Phase 3)

Shipped in 202608310001. This is the whole attendance source; nothing reads
it yet. COMM-302, 304, 305, 306, 307 and 316 all read it once they exist and
none of them needs to know how it got populated.

### attendance_log (table)

- `attendance_log(id uuid pk default gen_random_uuid(), user_id uuid not null
  references profiles(id) on delete cascade, club_id uuid not null default
  default_club_id() references clubs(id), occurred_on date not null,
  source_record_type text, source_record_id text, recorded_at timestamptz not
  null default now(), unique (user_id, occurred_on))`.
- One row per member per calendar day. Three lifts logged on one day are one
  row, which is the entire point of the unique key.
- `source_record_type` / `source_record_id` are provenance, nullable, and
  deliberately not a foreign key: the `private_records` row they name may be
  soft-deleted or hard-deleted later without touching the attendance day.
  Nothing may join on them.
- Index `attendance_log_club_day_idx (club_id, occurred_on desc)` for the
  cross-member day-window reads COMM-302/304/307 will issue. The unique
  constraint already serves every own-history read.
- RLS enabled. `grant select` to `authenticated` and nothing else.
  - `attendance_log_self_select`: `user_id = auth.uid()`.
  - `attendance_log_staff_select`: `has_perm('community.analytics.view') or
    is_staff()`. Two separate permissive policies rather than one OR'd
    predicate, so a member's own read never pays for the permission lookups.
  - **No insert, update, or delete grant and no policy for any of the three,
    for any client role, admin included.** The trigger below is the only
    writer, the same shape `pins` and `notification_batches` use.
  - This policy pair is the staff/analytics boundary only. It is **not**
    gated on `can_view_profile_field(user_id, 'show_attendance')` — that
    toggle governs what one member may see about another, and every
    member-facing Phase 3 reader (COMM-302, COMM-306, COMM-307) must apply it
    in its own body.

### attendance_session_record_types() returns text[]

- Purpose: the session-bearing `private_records.record_type` set in one
  place, so the trigger's WHEN clause, the backfill, pgTAP and any later
  Phase 3 reader assert against the same value. Same reasoning as
  `notification_batch_window()`.
- Params: none. Returns: `text[]`, currently exactly
  `array['strength_entry', 'wod_entry']`.
- `language sql immutable`, `security invoker`, `search_path` pinned.
- Auth rule: revoked from `public`/`anon`, executable by `authenticated`.
  It exposes no data.
- Side effects: none.
- `bodyweight` and `measurement` are deliberately absent even though both
  carry a `date` key of the same shape: stepping on a scale is not training.
  `session_note` is absent because nothing in app.js writes it.

### attendance_parse_day(p_raw text) returns date

- Purpose: turn a client-owned `payload ->> 'date'` into a date, or null.
  The one place that decision is made, shared by the trigger and the
  migration's backfill.
- Params: `p_raw text`. Returns: `date`, or `null` for every rejection.
- `language plpgsql immutable`, `security invoker`, `search_path` pinned.
- Auth rule: revoked from `public`/`anon`, executable by `authenticated`.
- Side effects: none. **Never raises**, including on `'2026-13-45'`, which
  matches the shape regex and raises `22008` on a bare cast. A raise inside
  the trigger would wedge the source record in the member's offline outbox
  forever (`flushOutbox()` only deletes an outbox row after a successful
  upsert), so nothing on this path is allowed to throw.
- Accepts exactly `^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$` plus a successful cast — the same
  shape `cleanISODate()` in `src/sanitize.js` guarantees, re-asserted
  server-side because `private_records` takes a direct RLS insert and the
  payload is member-controlled.

### attendance_log_from_record()

- Trigger function, `security definer`. Fires as
  `private_records_attendance_log`, AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE on
  `private_records`, one row per statement row, with
  `when (new.deleted_at is null and new.record_type = any
  (attendance_session_record_types()))`.
- Params: none (trigger). Returns: `trigger`.
- Purpose: derive one `attendance_log` row per member per calendar day from
  the member's own existing offline sync. There is no new client call and no
  new affordance — a member on a months-old cached build produces attendance
  rows the moment their existing sync runs.
- `occurred_on` comes from `payload ->> 'date'` via `attendance_parse_day()`.
  Confirmed against the real producer, not assumed: `queueSyncRecord()` in
  app.js sets `payload: record` (the whole local record object, unwrapped)
  and `flushOutbox()` in cloud.js forwards it unchanged, so for the two
  session types the payload is whatever `sanitizeEntry()` /
  `sanitizeWodEntry()` returned — both of which carry the logged day as a
  top-level `date` key already through `cleanISODate()`.
- Auth rule: revoked from `public`, `anon`, and `authenticated` — not
  callable as an RPC, reachable as a trigger and nowhere else. No
  `auth.uid()` check, the same documented exception `notif_queue_batched()`,
  `seed_onboarding_progress()` and `post_new_member_on_join()` record: it
  acts on the row being inserted, and that row was already pinned to the
  caller by `private_records_self_insert` / `private_records_self_update`,
  which is a stronger check than re-reading `auth.uid()` here. An
  `auth.uid()` gate would also break the migration's own backfill and any
  future service-role repair, both of which legitimately have no session.
  It is `security definer` for exactly one reason: to cross the
  no-client-write boundary on `attendance_log` on purpose.
- Side effects: at most one `attendance_log` insert, `on conflict (user_id,
  occurred_on) do nothing`. Nothing else. It never updates and never deletes.
- Four ways it produces no row, all silent, none of them an error:
  1. `attendance_parse_day()` returned null (missing, malformed, or
     impossible date).
  2. `occurred_on > current_date + 1`. The future-date rule: **refused, not
     clamped.** The table is append-only, so a wrong day could never be taken
     back, and clamping to today would invent a training day the member never
     claimed. The refusal is of the attendance row, not of the transaction —
     a member with a broken clock loses the credit for that entry, not the
     ability to sync their training log. One day of slack is deliberate:
     `current_date` is the server's UTC day and the client writes a local
     calendar day, so an Asia/Jerusalem member training at 01:00 legitimately
     logs "tomorrow" in UTC; zero slack would drop those entries nightly.
  3. No `profiles` row for `new.user_id`. `private_records.user_id`
     references `auth.users` while this table references `profiles`, so a
     member inside the COMM-016 gate window can legally hold private records
     with no profile to point at. Skipping is the only correct answer; the
     alternative is a foreign key violation that breaks their sync.
  4. The WHEN clause did not match (non-session `record_type`, or
     `deleted_at` set).
- Append-only, matching the `challenge_progress` "correct forward, not
  backward" precedent: a later soft-delete of the source record does not
  retract a day already logged, and a soft-delete UPDATE is a no-op rather
  than a re-log.
- AFTER INSERT **OR UPDATE**, not INSERT-only: `flushOutbox()` upserts on
  `(user_id, record_type, record_id)`, so a record that already exists
  server-side arrives as an UPDATE. INSERT-only would miss every edited entry
  and every re-sync from a second device.

### Backfill (202608310001)

- The migration backfills one row per member per day from the
  `private_records` rows that already existed, under the same four rules,
  `distinct on` the earliest `created_at` so `source_record_*` matches what
  the trigger would have written.
- Not in COMM-300's migration outline; added deliberately. Without it every
  existing member's attendance history starts at zero on deploy day and
  COMM-306's consistency board and COMM-304's decline detection both read a
  club that has apparently never trained. It is also strictly safer here than
  later: COMM-305 adds an AFTER INSERT trigger on `attendance_log` that mints
  achievements and posts milestones, and that trigger does not exist yet, so
  this backfill cannot spam anybody's feed. Run after COMM-305, the same rows
  would.

### Client side (not a migration)

- `flushOutbox()` in cloud.js emits
  `HaimuniaEvents.emit(PRODUCT_EVENTS.ATTENDANCE_RECORDED, {occurred_on})`
  after a successful `private_records` upsert of a non-deleted
  `strength_entry` / `wod_entry` whose payload date matches
  `^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$`. `ATTENDANCE_RECORDED`'s first producer since
  COMM-012 defined it in Phase 0.
- Deduplicated to one emit per `(user id, occurred_on)` for the life of the
  page, mirroring the unique key server-side.
- **This emit is a courtesy for client consumers and the analytics bridge.
  It is not what writes `attendance_log`** — the trigger does that,
  independently, from the same upsert. Nothing downstream may depend on it
  firing for correctness: a member on an older cached build produces the
  table row and no event. `attendance_log` is the source of truth for
  attendance; the event is the source of truth for WCAM.
- `attendance_recorded` is added to `HaimuniaAnalytics.EVENTS`, bridged from
  `ATTENDANCE_RECORDED` through `BUS_EVENT_MAP`, projected by `BUS_PROP_KEYS`
  to `["occurred_on"]` only (no workout title, no result text), and added to
  `ACTIVE_MEMBER_EVENTS` (WCAM). Documented in `docs/community/metrics.md`,
  which now closes its own "Still not wired: Attendance" line.

### What "verified attendance" means

Every later Phase 3 ticket title that says "verified attendance" means
"derived server-side from the member's own private training log, not proxied
through an optional public post-share" — the same trust boundary
`private_records` already has. It is not a physical check-in, not
staff-confirmed, and a determined member could still misdate a local entry
before it syncs. That is the accepted shape of the 2026-08-30 resolution, not
a gap this ticket left open.

**The word is a misnomer and 202609060024 corrected it in the schema
itself.** `attendance_log`'s table comment said "Verified class attendance"
and three function comments said "verified attendance"; all four now say
what the table is — self-reported training days, one row per member per day,
written only by the `private_records_attendance_log` trigger from the
member's own logged `strength_entry`/`wod_entry` rows. **"Class" never
belonged in the phrase at all**: class scheduling and check-in are Arbox's,
which this app reads from and does not manage, so there is no source in this
product that could verify anything. That exact misnomer already produced a
privacy policy claiming class attendance was recorded when no such record
exists, and a coach dashboard that told a box owner his most loyal members
had never trained. The ticket titles are left as they were shipped, because
they are identifiers; this paragraph is what they mean.

## Needs from schema, attendance achievements (COMM-305, Phase 3)

Shipped in 202608310007, closing the parked COMM-P03. Two new functions, one
trigger, one index, one `UPDATE` to four seeded rows. No new table, so no new
RLS policy; no new client call and no changed signature anywhere, so nothing
on the client side moved.

### achievement_definitions, the four attendance rows

- `update public.achievement_definitions set enabled = true where trigger_type
  = 'ATTENDANCE_RECORDED' and not enabled`. Keyed on `trigger_type`, not on a
  list of four codes, so a fifth attendance-triggered definition is enabled by
  its own seed row. Idempotent.
- The thresholds are unchanged and are now load-bearing rather than
  decorative: `attendance_first_class` 1, `attendance_25_classes` 25,
  `attendance_100_classes` 100 (all `repeatable = false`),
  `attendance_weekly_streak` 4 (`repeatable = true`). The trigger below reads
  every one of them from this table and keeps no second copy, so re-tuning a
  milestone is an `UPDATE` to one row and adding a fifth is an `INSERT`.
  Disabling a row stops its unlocks immediately.
- Still never client-claimable. `ach_claim`'s `d.trigger_type <>
  'ATTENDANCE_RECORDED'` (202608280020, re-created unchanged in 202608290002)
  is untouched by this ticket. Before COMM-305 an attendance code was refused
  twice over — disabled *and* attendance-triggered — so 0043 re-asserts the
  refusal now that only one of the two reasons is left, including for a
  caller who has genuinely reached the milestone and for the repeatable code,
  where an accepted claim would have written a second row rather than being
  absorbed by the once-per-code index.

### attendance_week_streak(p_user uuid, p_exclude_day date default null) returns integer

- New, internal, `security invoker`, `stable`. No grant to any role
  (`revoke all` from `public`, `anon`, `authenticated`) — the same shape
  `consistency_week_streaks()` and `classmate_day_counts()` have. Only
  `attendance_milestones_on_log()` calls it, and it borrows that function's
  rights to read past `attendance_log_self_select`.
- Purpose: one member's current consecutive-ISO-week training streak over
  `attendance_log`, computed with **the same arithmetic
  `consistency_week_streaks()` (COMM-306) uses set-wide** — distinct ISO weeks
  carrying at least one attendance day, anchored on the member's most recent
  such week, counted backwards while each week is exactly 7 days before the
  previous one, and only when the anchor is the current week or the previous
  one. A member with no attendance days, or whose most recent trained week is
  older than the previous week, is `0`.
- Params: `p_user`. `p_exclude_day` optionally drops one `occurred_on` day
  from the set, which is what lets an AFTER INSERT trigger ask what the streak
  was *before* the row it just saw. Excluding a day does not remove its week
  when another day carries it, which is the correct answer and falls out of
  the arithmetic rather than being special-cased.
- Auth rule: no privacy filter, deliberately and for a stronger reason than
  `consistency_week_streaks()` has: the number is only ever used to decide
  whether a member earned **their own** achievement, and `show_attendance`
  governs what other members are told, never whether a member's own training
  counts for them.
- Side effects: none, it is `stable`.
- It is a second copy of one rule, pinned rather than trusted: 0043 compares
  it against `consistency_week_streaks()` for every member of the fixture at
  once, the same drift-pin shape 0040 uses for `community_profile`'s inline
  copy.

### attendance_milestones_on_log()

- Trigger function, `security definer`. Fires as `attendance_log_milestones`,
  AFTER INSERT on `public.attendance_log`, one row per statement row, no
  `WHEN` clause.
- Params: none (trigger). Returns: `trigger`.
- Purpose: the evaluation COMM-305 needs, done inline off the source table
  rather than through the still-unbuilt generic `ach_evaluate` — the same
  precedent `challenge_progress_apply` (202608290004) set. It is the only
  producer of `POST_ATTENDANCE_MILESTONE`, a post type that had an enum label
  and a client renderer and no producer from Phase 1 until now.
- Auth rule: revoked from `public`, `anon`, `authenticated` — not callable as
  an RPC. No `auth.uid()` check, the same documented exception
  `attendance_log_from_record()`, `post_new_member_on_join()` and
  `notif_queue_batched()` record: it acts for `new.user_id`, on a row that
  reached `attendance_log` only through a `private_records` row already
  pinned to its owner by RLS. `security definer` for exactly two boundaries:
  `member_achievements` has no client insert grant or policy, and an
  authorless `workout_posts` row is unreachable through `posts_insert_self`.
- It takes `select ... for update` on the member's own `profiles` row before
  evaluating — the same serialisation `challenge_progress_apply` takes on its
  `challenges` row, so two attendance rows landing for one member in the same
  instant cannot both decide "not posted yet". It is the row the function has
  to read anyway for `show_attendance` and the display name.
- **Count milestones (non-repeatable).** Fires when the member's all-time
  distinct `occurred_on` count (`count(*)`, since the table is unique on
  `(user_id, occurred_on)`) reaches a definition's threshold and they do not
  already hold that code. "Do not already hold" is decided by `insert ... on
  conflict do nothing returning id` against `member_achievements_once_idx`,
  atomically, so a concurrent double-unlock is impossible and a lost race is
  swallowed. **This is state, not a delta**, and deliberately so: a
  `count = threshold` or `count - 1 < threshold` form reads like the ticket's
  sentence and holds for the production writer (one single-row insert per
  statement) but silently awards nothing for any multi-row insert, because
  Postgres queues AFTER-FOR-EACH-ROW triggers to the end of the statement and
  every row of a 30-row insert then sees a count of 30. The state form is the
  same shape `ach_claim` already uses for the same question, and is right for
  both paths.
- **Weekly streak (repeatable).** Fires only on a genuine fresh crossing:
  `attendance_week_streak(user, null) >= threshold and
  attendance_week_streak(user, new.occurred_on) < threshold`. Silent for every
  day of a run that already qualifies, silent for a second day inside a week
  already counted, and firing again on the fourth week of a later rebuilt
  streak — which is what "repeatable definitions write a fresh row each
  qualifying event" means here. There is no index that can express this, which
  is why the crossing has to be computed. Consequence, stated rather than
  buried: a **multi-row** insert into `attendance_log` awards no streak badge,
  because every row of the statement sees the whole statement and no single
  day's exclusion changes anything. A bulk import of history is not a training
  event; the production writer inserts one row per statement.
- A streak must be **live** to count, because `attendance_week_streak()`
  carries `consistency_week_streaks()`' anchor rule: back-filling four
  consecutive weeks that ended two months ago earns nothing, and that is the
  same number the member's profile and the consistency board show them.
- **Side effects, per crossing:** one `member_achievements` row, copying
  `visibility` from the definition. For a count milestone whose threshold is
  above the first-day threshold, additionally one `workout_posts` row —
  `author_id = null`, `post_type = 'POST_ATTENDANCE_MILESTONE'`,
  `visibility = 'club'`, `status = 'active'`, `club_id` from the attendance
  row, `source_type = 'member'`, `source_id = <the member>`,
  `occurred_on = <the day of the crossing>`, `published_at = now()`, and a
  Hebrew `body`. Nothing else is written; the `ACHIEVEMENT_UNLOCKED`
  notification comes from `member_achievements_notify`, not from here.
- `metadata` shape, fixed by the already-shipped renderer:
  `{member_id: uuid-as-string, milestone_label: text, count: integer}`.
  `renderAttendanceMilestonePostCard` in cloud.js reads `milestone_label` (its
  title line) and `count` (its result line) and nothing else;
  `member_id` exists for the idempotency guard, the same key name and role it
  has in `POST_NEW_MEMBER`. `milestone_label` is the **definition's own
  `name`**, so the feed post and the badge on the member's profile cannot
  announce two different things, and `count` is the definition's own
  `threshold`.
- **A first class is an achievement and not also a post.** Expressed as
  `threshold > 1` rather than as a code allow-list, so a future
  `attendance_250_classes` posts automatically and a future first-anything
  does not. This matches how every other unlock in the schema is celebrated:
  `ach_claim` writes a `member_achievements` row for a first PR and never a
  post, and a `POST_ACHIEVEMENT` exists only because the member deliberately
  shared it.
- **The privacy branch.** The post — and only the post — is gated on the
  member's own `show_attendance`, read as a direct `profiles` column, not
  through `can_view_profile_field()`, which is viewer-relative and answers
  true for the subject before consulting any toggle. Same direct read
  `attendance_classmates_today()` (202608310005) makes for the same question.
  The achievement is never gated on it: achievements carry their own
  `show_achievements`, applied by `member_achievements_read` and
  `community_profile`. `show_attendance` defaults to **false**
  (202608280003), so out of the box this trigger unlocks achievements for
  everyone and posts for nobody.
- **The toggle is a write-time gate and the moment is not replayed.** The post
  branch is reachable only on the call that actually wrote the achievement
  row, so a member who crossed 25 with attendance private and turns the toggle
  on months later gets no belated announcement on their next session. Same
  one-shot shape `post_new_member_on_join` has.
- Idempotency for the post: `exists` on a `POST_ATTENDANCE_MILESTONE` row
  already carrying that `metadata ->> 'member_id'` and that
  `metadata ->> 'count'` — read from `workout_posts` itself, exactly as
  `challenge_progress_apply` asks the same question, never from a second piece
  of tracking state that could drift from what was actually posted.
  Deliberately a guard and **not** a unique index, the reason 202608290014
  spells out: a unique violation here would abort the enclosing transaction,
  which is a member's training-log sync.
- Nothing in this function raises. A missing `profiles` row returns early. The
  standing rule from 202608310001 holds: nothing downstream of a member's
  training-log sync may abort that sync.
- Index: `workout_posts_attendance_milestone_metadata_idx` on
  `(metadata ->> 'member_id') where post_type = 'POST_ATTENDANCE_MILESTONE'`,
  mirroring the two 202608290004 and 202608290014 already added.
- **No backfill of achievements or posts**, for the reason 202608290014 gave
  about historical welcome posts. Migrations apply in order, so 202608310001's
  `attendance_log` backfill is finished before this trigger exists and no
  member is awarded anything at migration time. What does happen, and is
  deliberate: because the count branch reads state, a member whose backfilled
  history already stands at 60 days earns `attendance_first_class` and
  `attendance_25_classes` on their **next** logged session — once each, spread
  across the club as members sync, never as a burst. The feed side of that is
  bounded by `show_attendance` defaulting to false.

## Needs from schema, member of the week (COMM-315, Phase 3)

Shipped in `202609010001_member_of_week.sql`. One table, four functions, and
one widened `CHECK` on `admin_actions.action_type`. The forward reference
under "Needs from schema, coach-tools (Phase 3)" is closed by this section;
read this one.

The client half (the suggestion card, the publish control, the coach's-pick
form) is not in that migration and lands separately, the same two-phase split
the Phase 2 coach-tools cluster used.

### The rotation

Four categories, one per week, in this fixed order and never randomly:

| index | category | source of the candidate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | `consistency_streak` | `feed_leaderboard('consistency')` |
| 1 | `most_prs` | count of `POST_PR` posts in the week |
| 2 | `challenge_completion` | count of `challenge_participants` completions in the week |
| 3 | `coachs_pick` | none — free staff selection |

The index is **whole weeks since the epoch Monday `2026-01-05`, modulo 4**,
not the ISO week number. ISO week number mod 4 was the example COMM-315
offered and it is not a cycle: an ISO year has 52 or 53 weeks, so at every
53-week year (2026 is one) the sequence runs week 52 → index 0, week 53 →
index 1, week 1 of the next year → index 1 again, repeating a category two
weeks running, silently, every few years. Counting weeks from a fixed Monday
has no year boundary in it. The modulo is written `((x % 4) + 4) % 4` because
Postgres's `%` keeps the sign of the dividend, so weeks before the epoch
resolve correctly rather than falling off the `case`.

### member_of_week_category(p_week_start date) returns text (202609010001)

- Purpose: the rotation rule, and the only copy of it, so the suggestion side
  and the publish side can never disagree about whose week it is.
- Params: `p_week_start date`, the Monday of an ISO week. Not normalised
  here — both callers normalise before calling.
- Returns: one of the four category codes above. Never null for any date,
  including dates before the epoch.
- Auth: `immutable`, `security invoker`, reads no table, so no `auth.uid()`
  check. Executable by `authenticated` (revoked from `public` and `anon`) so
  a client can label a week without re-deriving the rule in JavaScript.
- Side effects: none.

### member_of_week_category_label(p_category text) returns text (202609010001)

- Purpose: the Hebrew display label for a category code, kept beside the rule
  so the suggestion card and the published post name a category identically.
- Returns: `עקביות באימונים`, `שיאים אישיים השבוע`, `השלמת אתגר`,
  `בחירת המאמן/ת`, or `''` for an unknown code.
- Auth: `immutable`, no table read, executable by `authenticated`.
- Side effects: none.

### member_of_week (table, 202609010001)

- `id uuid pk default gen_random_uuid()`, `club_id uuid not null default
  default_club_id() references clubs(id)`, `week_start date not null unique
  check (extract(isodow from week_start) = 1)`, `category text not null check
  (category in ('consistency_streak','most_prs','challenge_completion',
  'coachs_pick'))`, `user_id uuid not null references profiles(id) on delete
  cascade`, `reason text not null default '' check (char_length(reason) <=
  500)`, `post_id uuid references workout_posts(id) on delete set null`,
  `published_by uuid references profiles(id) on delete set null`,
  `published_at timestamptz not null default now()`.
- One row per **published** week. There is no draft row and no nullable
  `published_at`: a generated draft here is not a row, it is what
  `member_of_week_candidates()` returns.
- RLS: enabled. **One policy, `member_of_week_read`, `for select to
  authenticated using (true)`.** Club-wide, because a published member of
  the week is public by construction. **No write grant and no write policy of
  any kind** — not for staff, not for an admin, not for the owner. The `pins`
  shape (202608280017), for the same reason: the once-per-week rule, the
  consecutive-week refusal, the category resolution and the `admin_actions`
  row would all be bypassable by a direct insert.
- `category` is **stored, not re-derived on read.** It records what was
  actually published, which can be `coachs_pick` on a week whose rotation
  said something else; re-deriving would rewrite the past if the rotation is
  ever re-tuned.
- The unique key is on `week_start` alone, as COMM-315's outline writes it,
  and deliberately **not** `(club_id, week_start)`. `club_id` is provenance
  here exactly as it is on `weekly_recaps`, `challenges` and
  `challenge_progress`, none of which carry it in a unique key either. The
  module is single-club, so the two are the same constraint today; the day a
  second club exists this changes along with every other table in the module,
  not on its own.
- Indexes: `member_of_week_recent_idx (week_start desc)`,
  `member_of_week_user_idx (user_id, week_start desc)`.

### member_of_week_candidate_set(p_category text, p_week_start date, p_limit int default 3) returns table (user_id uuid, value numeric, detail jsonb) (202609010001)

- **Internal, not in COMM-315's outline.** It exists because
  `member_of_week_publish` has to ask the identical "is this member on the
  shortlist" question that `member_of_week_candidates` asks, and a second
  copy of three queries would drift.
- `security invoker`, **no grant to any role** — `public`, `anon` and
  `authenticated` all revoked. Called from the two definer functions it runs
  with the migration owner's rights; called from anywhere else it cannot be
  called at all. It carries no staff gate of its own because both callers
  have one.
- Privacy is applied here, once, for both callers. Per category:
  `consistency_streak` delegates to `feed_leaderboard('consistency', null,
  'club', 50)` and therefore inherits all three of that board's gates —
  `in_leaderboards`, `visible_to_club` and, since COMM-306,
  `show_attendance`; `most_prs` applies `can_view_profile_field(author,
  'show_prs')` plus `post_visible_to_viewer(post)` on each counted post,
  exactly as `coach_celebrate_feed`'s PR branch does; `challenge_completion`
  applies `can_view_profile_field(user, 'in_leaderboards')`, exactly as
  `coach_celebrate_feed`'s completion branch does. `coachs_pick` returns
  nothing, by definition rather than by exhaustion.
- **One addition beyond `coach_celebrate_feed`'s pattern**, stated because it
  is an addition: every branch **also** reads the relevant toggles from the
  **raw `profiles` columns**, on top of the `can_view_profile_field()` call
  and never instead of it — `visible_to_club and in_leaderboards and
  show_attendance` for consistency, `visible_to_club and show_prs` for PRs,
  `visible_to_club and in_leaderboards` for completions.

  The two answer different questions. `can_view_profile_field()` asks "may
  this caller see this?": it settles block edges in both directions, returns
  true for the caller's own row, and **short-circuits to true for an admin
  before it consults any toggle** (202608280003). That is the right question
  for a dashboard row a coach reads, which is all Celebrate is, and the admin
  short-circuit is that resolution point's module-wide behaviour rather than
  anything this ticket should fight. It is the wrong question *on its own*
  here, because a candidate is a suggestion the caller is about to
  **broadcast**. Read through the helper alone, an admin would be offered —
  and could publish — a "most PRs this week" celebration of a member who
  keeps their PRs private. A member's own toggle has to outrank the caller's
  rank when the output is a club-wide post.

  Both are kept because each does something the other cannot: the helper is
  the only thing that settles blocks, and the columns are the only thing that
  survives an admin caller. 0045 mutation-tests them separately — deleting
  the column reads fails three admin assertions, deleting the helper calls
  fails the block assertion.
- The member recognised in the immediately prior week is excluded from the
  shortlist. That is the courtesy; `member_of_week_publish`'s refusal is the
  rule.
- Windowing: `most_prs` keys on `coalesce(occurred_on, created_at::date)`
  between `week_start` and `week_start + 6`, the same key
  `community_profile`'s PR block uses. `challenge_completion` keys on
  `completed_at::date` in the same range, excludes `status = 'withdrawn'`
  participants and `status = 'draft'` challenges.
- **Known limitation, flagged rather than hidden.** `feed_leaderboard`'s
  consistency mode reports the streak **as of now**: it takes no as-of date
  and `consistency_week_streaks()` anchors on `current_date`. Asking for a
  past week returns today's streaks. For the intended use — staff publishing
  the current or the just-ended week — the two are the same. Publishing a
  months-old week under that category would credit a present-day streak.
  Fixing it means COMM-306's arithmetic growing an as-of parameter, which is
  a change to a shipped contract and out of COMM-315's scope.

### member_of_week_candidates(p_week_start date default null) returns setof jsonb (202609010001)

- Purpose: the suggestion half of COMM-309's generated-draft/staff-publishes
  shape. It writes nothing and it is `stable`; the club sees nothing until a
  human calls `member_of_week_publish`.
- Params: `p_week_start date`, default null. Null means the current week.
  Any other date is **normalised to the Monday of its own ISO week** rather
  than rejected — a coach tapping a date picker means the week a human means.
  The same normalisation runs in `member_of_week_publish`.
- Returns: `setof jsonb`, and **always exactly one row**. The signature is
  `setof` because COMM-315's contract pins it; the envelope carries the
  category as well as the list because the empty state needs both — "no
  candidates this week for *this* category" cannot be rendered from an empty
  set of rows. The client reads `data[0]` and joins nothing:

  ```
  { week_start, category, category_label, rotation_index, free_selection,
    published, previous_week_user_id, candidates[] }
  ```

  - `rotation_index` is 0..3, sent so the client can show "week N of 4"
    without re-deriving the rule.
  - `free_selection` is true only for `coachs_pick`. The client branches on
    the flag rather than string-matching the category name.
  - `published` is null for an unpublished week, otherwise
    `{id, user_id, category, reason, post_id, published_at}`.
  - `previous_week_user_id` is last week's member, who publish will refuse —
    sent so the free-selection form can grey them out rather than letting a
    coach discover the rule by hitting it.
  - `candidates` is at most 3 of `{user_id, handle, display_name,
    avatar_url, value, detail}`, ordered by `value` desc then display name
    then id, which is a **total** order — two identical calls return an
    identical envelope. `detail` is category-shaped: `{streak_weeks, rank}`,
    `{pr_count}`, or `{completions, titles}`. Always `[]` for `coachs_pick`.
- Auth: `security definer`, `auth.uid()` checked first, then `is_staff()`
  inline. Both raise `not authorized` (P0001). Executable by `authenticated`
  only — the staff test is in the body, not in the grant, so a coach who is
  not an admin can still call it.
- Side effects: none.

### member_of_week_publish(p_week_start date, p_user_id uuid, p_reason text) returns uuid (202609010001)

- Purpose: the **only** writer of `member_of_week`, and the first producer of
  a `POST_ANNOUNCEMENT` row in this schema. (It was the only one until
  202609220007, which added `announcements_feed_card_insert` - see the section of that name at the end of this file. Its
  cards carry no `announcement_id`, because there is no announcements row
  behind them.)
- Params: `p_week_start` normalised as above, null meaning the current week;
  `p_user_id` required; `p_reason` trimmed, control characters stripped
  (`0x01`-`0x08`, `0x0B`-`0x1F`, keeping tab and newline — the same class
  `post_create` strips, because this text reaches the club feed), then
  **capped** at 500 rather than rejected.
- Returns: the new `member_of_week.id`.
- Auth: `security definer`, `auth.uid()` first, then `is_staff()` inline.
- **Refusals**, all checked before the first insert, so a rejected publish is
  never a half-published one:
  - `week already published` — a second call for a week that already has a
    row. Explicitly **not** an upsert, unlike `weekly_recaps`: a recap is a
    regenerated summary, this is a public act of recognition that has already
    reached the feed, and quietly replacing it would leave the post naming
    one member and the row naming another. The `unique (week_start)`
    constraint stands underneath as the backstop.
  - `member was recognised last week` — a row exists for `week_start - 7`
    with the same `user_id`. A real refusal, not a suggestion-level nicety:
    it holds for a hand-made call and for a coach's pick that never fetched
    the shortlist. It is about **adjacency**, not repetition — the same
    member may be published again after a gap of one week.
  - `member not found` — no profile, or soft-deleted.
  - `member is not visible to the club` — **the one refusal COMM-315 does not
    name.** Read from the raw `visible_to_club` column, not through
    `can_view_profile_field()`, for the reason given on the candidate set
    above: publishing is broadcasting, and a member who removed themselves
    from the club's view did not consent to being its headline. Reverting it
    is deleting one `if`.
  - `reason required for a coach's pick` — an empty reason when the resolved
    category is `coachs_pick`. A free selection with no stated reason
    publishes a name and nothing else; the three computed categories carry
    their reason in the category itself, so an empty reason is fine there.
- **Category resolution, and why there is no `p_category` parameter.** The
  signature is fixed by the ticket, so the category is derived by *looking*:
  if `p_user_id` is in the week's computed shortlist, the row records the
  week's rotation category; if not, it records `coachs_pick`. That is exactly
  COMM-315's stated empty state ("nobody logged a PR that week … staff can
  fall back to coach's pick"), expressed as a fact about who was chosen
  rather than as a flag the client must remember to send. `admin_actions`
  keeps both: `after_data` carries `category` and `rotation_category`.
- **The post pattern, decided here because COMM-315 required it be stated:
  an authorless, club-visibility `POST_ANNOUNCEMENT`.** Not COMM-225's
  comment-on-the-member's-card pattern, for three reasons. (1) That pattern
  needs a card to comment on — it branches on Celebrate's `post_id`, which is
  non-null only for a PR, and three of the four categories here have no
  source post at all, so it would work for one category in four and silently
  degrade for the rest. (2) Member of the week is club voice, not a coach's
  reply; rendering it under one coach's face would make it read as that
  coach's opinion of a member. `author_id` is null, which 202608280004 made
  legal for exactly this kind of row, and `member_of_week.published_by` keeps
  the accountability where an audit wants it. (3) `cloud.js`'s
  `renderAnnouncementPostCard` already reads `metadata.title` falling back to
  `title` and already passes `authorless: !postAuthorName(post)`, so the row
  renders correctly with no client change.
- The post: `post_type = 'POST_ANNOUNCEMENT'`, `author_id = null`,
  `visibility = 'club'`, `status = 'active'`, `title = 'חבר/ת השבוע'`,
  `body` naming the member, the category label and the reason,
  `source_type = 'announcement'`, `source_id` = the `member_of_week.id`
  (generated before both inserts so the two rows reference each other in one
  transaction), `occurred_on = week_start`, and `metadata`
  `{title, member_of_week: true, member_id, member_name, category,
  category_label, week_start, reason}`.
- Side effects, all in one transaction: one `workout_posts` row, one
  `member_of_week` row, one `admin_actions` row via `log_admin_action`, so a
  failed log fails the whole publish. Same shape `pin_set()` uses.

### admin_actions.action_type gains one label (202609010001)

- `admin_actions_action_type_check` is dropped and re-added with a twelfth
  value, `'member_of_week_publish'`. Nothing else about the table moves, and
  `target_type` is **not** widened — `'member'` already exists and is exactly
  right, since the subject of the action is the member being recognised.
- Reusing an existing label (`'achievement_edit'`, `'privacy_config'`) was
  the alternative and was rejected: it would make the audit log describe
  something that did not happen, which is the one thing an audit log may not
  do.

## Needs from schema, monthly club recap (COMM-309, Phase 3)

Shipped in `202609010002`. One aggregate row per calendar month, generated
as a draft nobody can see, published by staff through one action.

### The generation-mechanism decision

COMM-309's own wording and the `recap_monthly_club` Edge Function stub below
both pointed at `supabase/functions/recap_monthly/index.ts`. **Generation
shipped as a Postgres function, `recap_monthly_generate(date)`, not as an
Edge Function.** The client half needs to know this: nothing in a browser
calls or triggers generation at all. The client calls
`recap_monthly_publish(p_id)` and reads `monthly_club_recaps` under RLS.

Four reasons, recorded here because the ticket left the choice open:

1. `recap_weekly` is per-member — one query set and five JSON blobs per
   active member, which needs a real client library. This job produces
   **one** row from five `count(*)`s over tables in this same database.
   In TypeScript that is five REST round trips to compute five integers.
2. **The auth footgun.** Supabase's default `verify_jwt` accepts any valid
   JWT, including the public anon key that ships in `cloud-config.js`, so an
   Edge Function that *runs as* service role is not one that only the
   service role can *call*. `recap_weekly` closes that by comparing the
   `Authorization` header against the real key by hand. A second Edge
   Function is a second place to get that right and a second place to forget
   it. A Postgres function granted to `service_role` and revoked from
   `public`, `anon` and `authenticated` has no equivalent hole — the grant
   *is* the gate. 0046 asserts all four of those grants.
3. **Idempotency is one statement in the database.** `insert … on conflict
   (month_start) do update … where published_at is null` is atomic under
   concurrency. Over REST it is a read-then-write with a race in the middle,
   which is exactly the read-then-write `recap_weekly` has to perform for its
   own "did this row already exist" check.
4. It matches the two most recent precedents — `chal_notify_ending_soon()`
   and `coach_detect_engagement_decline()` — both scheduled jobs expressed
   as service-role-only Postgres functions, at the time with the scheduler
   deliberately not yet built (see below — it now is).

**Now scheduled**: 202609050005 wired `cron.schedule('recap_monthly', '41
4 1 * *', ...)` — 04:41 UTC on the 1st of each month, calling
`recap_monthly_generate()` to produce the draft automatically; a staff
member still calls `recap_monthly_publish()` by hand to make it visible to
members (publishing is a deliberate human act, never scheduled). Before
this migration landed, the only way to produce a draft was running `select
public.recap_monthly_generate();` as the service role by hand — the staff
preview surface still renders an honest empty state for the (now rare) case
that no draft exists yet for the current month. `notif_batch_flush_due()`,
`chal_notify_ending_soon()`, `coach_detect_engagement_decline()` and
`recap_weekly` are all scheduled the same way now — see 202609050005.

### monthly_club_recaps (table, 202609010002)

- `id uuid pk default gen_random_uuid()`, `club_id uuid not null default
  default_club_id() references clubs(id)`, `month_start date not null unique
  check (extract(day from month_start) = 1)`, `sessions_logged integer not
  null default 0 check (>= 0)`, `posts_created`, `new_members`,
  `challenges_completed`, `events_held` all the same shape, `generated_at
  timestamptz not null default now()`, `published_at timestamptz`.
- The five `>= 0` CHECKs are an addition to the ticket's outline, matching
  `weekly_recaps.sessions_completed`. A count cannot be negative, so they
  only ever catch a writer that is not counting.
- **Aggregate-only is enforced by the table SHAPE, not by a comment.** Two
  uuids, a date, five integers, two timestamps — no `user_id`, no text
  column, no jsonb, no array. There is nowhere for a member name, handle or
  individually-attributable figure to be written even by a careless future
  producer. This is strictly stronger than
  `weekly_recaps.club_challenge_progress` (202608290011), which states the
  same rule for a jsonb blob and therefore has to trust `recap_weekly`.
  **Do not add a `top_members`, `highlights` or `most_improved` column.**
  0046 pins the entire column list, so such a column fails the suite.
- `published_at null` means **draft**: invisible to plain members, no
  notification sent. Deliberately not a `status` enum — there are two states
  and the timestamp carries both the state and when it changed.
- Index: `monthly_club_recaps_published_idx (month_start desc) where
  published_at is not null`. The unique constraint's own index on
  `month_start` serves the staff preview (scanned backwards for DESC).
- RLS: enabled. `revoke all from public, anon`; `grant select to
  authenticated`. **No insert, update or delete grant and no write policy of
  any kind** — not for a coach, not for an admin, not for the owner. The
  `pins` / `attendance_log` / `member_of_week` shape.
- **Two permissive SELECT policies**, which OR together:
  - `monthly_club_recaps_staff_select` — `using (has_perm(
    'community.analytics.view') or is_staff())`, copied verbatim from
    `attendance_log`'s own staff read policy so the two tables answer "who
    may see unpublished club-wide attendance figures" identically.
  - `monthly_club_recaps_published_select` — `using (published_at is not
    null)`.
- **The deliberate asymmetry the client half must respect:** `is_staff()` is
  coach rank and above, so a **coach can preview a draft**, but
  `recap_monthly_publish` requires `community.analytics.view` or
  `is_admin()`, which a coach does **not** hold (202608280001 seeds that
  permission to `admin` and `owner` only). Looking at a draft is not an act;
  publishing a permanent club-wide summary is. **Gate the "פרסם" control on
  the permission, not on staffness**, or a coach is shown a button the
  database refuses. 0046 asserts exactly this pair on one session.

### monthly_club_recaps_freeze() (trigger, 202609010002)

- `before update on monthly_club_recaps for each row`. Raises `'a published
  monthly recap is immutable'` (P0001) whenever `old.published_at is not
  null`. This is COMM-309's "a published recap cannot be un-published or
  edited" made a property of the table rather than of the generator's SQL.
- Aimed at the **service role**, which bypasses RLS — no client role has a
  write grant at all. 0046 asserts it against the bootstrap superuser.
- Raises rather than silently pinning, unlike
  `onboarding_progress_pin_shown()`: every legitimate path already checks
  `published_at` before it writes, so reaching this trigger means a caller is
  doing something it did not intend.
- Never reached by `recap_monthly_generate()`, whose upsert carries `where
  published_at is null` and therefore executes no UPDATE for a published
  month — the rerun is a genuine no-op, not a refused write.
- **DELETE is deliberately not guarded.** No client role can delete; the only
  deleter is the service role or a future migration, and blocking those would
  make a deliberate operator act need a trigger drop first.

### recap_monthly_generate(p_month_start date default null) returns uuid (202609010002)

- Purpose: the generation unit. Computes the five club-wide aggregates and
  upserts one `monthly_club_recaps` row.
- Params: `p_month_start` null means **the most recently completed calendar
  month**, never the running one — the same reasoning `recap_weekly`'s
  `targetWeek()` records for "never the current, still-running week". Any
  other date is normalised to the first of its own month rather than
  rejected, the courtesy `member_of_week_candidates()` extends to a mid-week
  date.
- Returns: the row id in **every** case — fresh insert, refreshed draft, or
  untouched published month.
- Auth: `security definer`; **granted to `service_role` only**, revoked from
  `public`, `anon` and `authenticated`. The documented exception to this
  schema's "check `auth.uid()` first" rule, identical to
  `chal_notify_ending_soon()`, `notif_batch_flush_due()` and
  `coach_detect_engagement_decline()`: a scheduled job has no session, so an
  `auth.uid()` gate would reject every legitimate call and pass none. The
  grant is the gate. Definer for one boundary on purpose — `attendance_log`
  is own-row plus staff and `invite_redemptions` is own-row only, so counting
  either club-wide crosses RLS.
- **The five figures**, each stated with what it excludes:
  - `sessions_logged` — `count(*)` on `attendance_log` for
    `occurred_on` in the month. That table is unique on `(user_id,
    occurred_on)`, so a row count is a count of member-training-days.
    Includes a member who has since soft-deleted their profile: they did
    train that month. **The first place an aggregate attendance figure
    becomes club-visible.**
  - `posts_created` — `workout_posts` with `created_at` in the month,
    `deleted_at is null`, `status = 'active'`, `visibility <> 'only_me'` (a
    post only its author can see was not a contribution), and `author_id is
    not null` (excludes the club's own authorless `POST_ANNOUNCEMENT` rows,
    which `member_of_week_publish` writes weekly — "how much did the
    community post" must not be inflated by posts the club generated).
    Keyed on `created_at` rather than `published_at`: `created_at` is the
    row's own insert stamp and every producer leaves it to its default,
    whereas `published_at` is passed explicitly (`post_create` and
    `member_of_week_publish` both pass `now()`) and is what 202608280004's
    backfill copied the legacy rows' `created_at` from. The two agree today;
    `created_at` stays right the day a producer backdates a publish.
  - `new_members` — `invite_redemptions.redeemed_at` in the month, this
    module's authoritative MEMBER_JOINED timestamp. **Known limitation,
    flagged not hidden:** `grant_coach_role()` and
    `grant_coach_role_by_handle()` UPDATE that row and move `redeemed_at`,
    so promoting an existing member to coach re-dates them and counts them
    as new that month. There is no second join timestamp to fall back on;
    fixing it properly means giving `invite_redemptions` an immutable
    `joined_at`, a change to a shipped table out of this ticket's scope.
  - `challenges_completed` — `challenge_participants.completed_at` in the
    month, `status <> 'withdrawn'`, on a challenge whose `status <> 'draft'`.
    The same two filters `member_of_week_candidate_set`'s completion branch
    applies. **Completions, not distinct challenges**: five members finishing
    one challenge is five.
  - `events_held` — `events.start_at` in the month, `status in ('published',
    'past')`. `draft` never reached the club and `cancelled` did not happen.
    Both live statuses count because nothing automatically flips a finished
    event to `past`.
- **No `club_id` filter anywhere**, consistent with 202608280001's "nothing
  reads it as a filter today".
- **Timezone:** `sessions_logged` is exact (`occurred_on` is a bare date).
  The other four compare against `v_month::timestamptz`, which resolves at
  the calling session's TimeZone — UTC for the service role, matching
  `recap_weekly`'s UTC weeks. Pinning a zone was considered and not done: an
  opinion about the club's local time belongs in one module-wide decision,
  not in a monthly recap.
- **Idempotency, in one statement.** `on conflict (month_start) do update …
  where public.monthly_club_recaps.published_at is null`. A rerun over a
  draft updates in place with fresh figures and the same id; a rerun over a
  published month executes **no UPDATE at all**, so not one figure,
  `generated_at`, or `published_at` moves. `published_at` appears in neither
  the insert column list nor the update SET list, which is why "no
  notification fires until staff publish" does not depend on this function
  remembering. When the `do update` predicate is false `RETURNING` yields no
  row — that is how the "already published, did nothing" branch is detected,
  and the id is then re-selected so the caller still gets one.
- **Cadence: monthly**, on the 1st, after the month it summarises has
  closed. **Now scheduled** by 202609050005's `cron.schedule('recap_monthly',
  '41 4 1 * *', ...)`. Note this is the **second** periodic rhythm the
  module has: `recompute_feed_weights`' contract argued for one weekly
  rhythm rather than three, and a monthly recap cannot be weekly, so this is
  a deliberate second cadence rather than a drift.
- Side effects: one `monthly_club_recaps` row inserted or updated. Nothing
  else. No notification, ever.
- **Logging:** returns the row id; there is no per-member loop, so there is
  nothing to count successes and failures of. COMM-309's "records success and
  failure counts with no personal content" discipline lands on the publish
  side instead, as `admin_actions.after_data.notified`.

### recap_monthly_publish(p_id uuid) returns void (202609010002)

- Purpose: the only writer of `published_at`, and the moment a draft becomes
  a thing the club has been told about.
- Auth: `security definer`; `auth.uid()` checked first, then
  `has_perm('community.analytics.view') or is_admin()` inline. Both raise
  `not authorized` (P0001). Executable by `authenticated`; revoked from
  `public` and `anon`. **Narrower than the table's staff read policy** — see
  the asymmetry note above. `is_admin()` is the table-driven `role_rank >=
  50` helper, so it also answers true for the legacy `profiles.is_admin`
  flag and for the owner (whose `has_perm` short-circuit covers them anyway).
- **The permission check runs before the row lookup**, so a member probing
  with a made-up id gets `not authorized` rather than `recap not found`,
  which would otherwise be an oracle for which recap ids exist.
- Refusals: `recap not found`; `recap already published` — checked under
  `select … for update`, so two staff hitting the button at once serialise
  rather than both fanning out. Both raised before the update, so a rejected
  publish is never a half-published one.
- Side effects, all one transaction:
  1. `published_at = now()`, which is also what makes the row readable by
     plain members.
  2. One `notif_create(member, 'monthly_club_recap', 'club', …)` per club
     member — a non-deleted profile with an `invite_redemptions` row, the
     same membership set `notif_announcement_fanout` and `recap_weekly` use,
     which deliberately includes the quiet members a club summary is for
     rather than WCAM's "did something this week". Title `'סיכום החודש של
     הקהילה'`; body is **three club totals and nothing else**; `source_type
     'monthly_club_recap'`, `source_id` the recap id, deep link
     `/community/recap/monthly?month=<month_start>`.
  3. One `admin_actions` row via `log_admin_action`, `action_type
     'monthly_recap_publish'`, `target_type 'monthly_club_recap'`,
     `after_data` = the five figures plus `month_start`, `published_at` and
     a `notified` **count**. A recipient *list* would put per-member data
     into the audit log for a feature whose entire point is that it holds
     none; the count is also the "success and failure counts with no
     personal content" record COMM-309 asks for.
- **Two inherited fan-out behaviours**, stated because they are real and
  follow from calling `notif_create` with a live staff session rather than
  from anything decided here. Both are exactly what
  `notif_announcement_fanout` already does:
  - **The publisher receives no notification** — `notif_create` suppresses a
    row whose recipient is the actor for every type but the two
    self-directed ones.
  - **A member with a block edge to the publisher receives no notification**
    — `notif_create` checks `notif_blocked_between(recipient, actor)`. This
    differs from `recap_weekly`'s `weekly_recap` fan-out, where the actor is
    null (service role, no session) and the block check is a no-op. It is
    the conservative direction, and the recap itself is readable by that
    member the moment it is published, so nothing is withheld but the ping.
- The whole-club loop is the same fan-out cost 202608280027 already flagged.
  Twelve runs a year against one small club; batching a large club remains
  the same later ticket.

### recap_weekly_classmates(p_user uuid, p_week_start date default null, p_limit int default 5) returns jsonb (202609010003)

- Purpose: the data source for `weekly_recaps.classmates`. COMM-316, closing
  COMM-P06. The `recap_weekly` Edge Function calls it once per member per
  week and drops the result straight into its upsert.
- Params:
  - `p_user` — **the subject, and also the viewer.** Required; a null raises
    (see Errors). Not optional and not derived from the session, because
    there is no session. See Auth.
  - `p_week_start` — normalised to the **Monday of its own ISO week** rather
    than rejected, the courtesy `member_of_week_candidates()` and
    `recap_monthly_generate()` both extend. Null means the **most recently
    completed** ISO week — the same week `recap_weekly`'s `targetWeek()`
    picks, never the running one.
  - `p_limit` — clamped 1..20; null means 5. Five is a recap line (a
    sentence naming people, read once a week) where COMM-307's card is 6 and
    `people_suggestions`' scrolling strip is 10. The clamp is the server's;
    the default is a parameter so the recaps agent can revisit the line's
    length from the Edge Function without a migration.
- Returns: a jsonb **array**, never null, never a scalar. Elements are
  `{user_id, display_name, handle, avatar_url}` — **four keys and no
  fifth.** `shared_days` is computed as the ordering key and stays inside
  the function: the recap tells the member *who* they trained beside, not on
  how many of which days. Those four keys are exactly what
  `community_profile` already returns to any member for any member, so no
  new field about a classmate becomes reachable. Empty array for every real
  data state — no profile, deleted profile, opted-out subject, no
  attendance, no overlap, nobody eligible.
- What it computes: members other than `p_user` who have an `attendance_log`
  row on a day `p_user` also has one, **inside one ISO week on both sides of
  the join**. That whole-week window is the entire reason this is not
  `classmate_day_counts()` (COMM-302) with a different anchor: that helper's
  window is trailing 60 days and lower-bounded only, so a day shared the
  week before the target week would count.
- Order: shared days descending, then
  `coalesce(nullif(btrim(display_name), ''), handle)` ascending, then
  `user_id`. The third key is what makes the order **total**, so the cut at
  `p_limit` is deterministic and two runs of the same week produce the same
  line.
- Auth: `security definer`; **granted to `service_role` only**, revoked from
  `public`, `anon` and `authenticated`. No `auth.uid()` check — the
  documented exception every scheduled job in this schema carries
  (`recap_monthly_generate`, `chal_notify_ending_soon`,
  `notif_batch_flush_due`, `coach_detect_engagement_decline`): a job has no
  session, so an `auth.uid()` gate would reject every legitimate call and
  pass none. **The grant is the gate, and it matters more here than on those
  four**, because `p_user` is a parameter: a member-callable form of this
  function would answer "who did member X train with in week W" about
  anybody in the club. 0047 asserts all four privileges and also calls it
  from a member and an admin session, both refused `42501`.
- **PRIVACY — `can_view_profile_field()` CANNOT BE USED HERE, and this is
  the crux of the function.** That helper resolves its viewer from
  `auth.uid()` and its first statement is `if v_uid is null then return
  false`. The caller is an Edge Function running as `service_role` with no
  user JWT, so `auth.uid()` is null and the helper returns **false for every
  candidate, always** — the classmates line would be permanently empty with
  nothing failing loudly to say so. `security definer` does not help: it
  changes the executing role, not the request's JWT claims, which is why the
  same helper works inside member-facing definer functions (`auth.uid()` is
  still the real session there) and cannot work here. Verified empirically
  under `set role service_role`, not inferred.
- **So the viewer is passed explicitly as `p_user` and the gate is written
  out against it**, reproducing `can_view_profile_field` term for term:
  self excluded (in the join), block edge in either direction, profile
  present and `deleted_at is null`, `visible_to_club`, `show_attendance`.
  Note this is precisely the trap `classmate_day_counts()`'s header warns
  about — "a `p_viewer` parameter would be honoured by the overlap count and
  silently ignored by the privacy gate" — avoided by not calling the helper
  at all. **Taking `p_user` *and* calling `can_view_profile_field()` would
  be the bug that header describes.**
- **The `is_admin()` short-circuit is deliberately NOT reproduced.** An
  admin's weekly recap names only classmates who opted in, exactly like
  every other member's. COMM-315 already drew this line for a club-wide
  broadcast ("an admin's rank governs what they may see, never what the club
  may be told"); a recap is one step further along the same reasoning — it
  is a **persisted artifact**, sitting in the table indefinitely and
  Shareable to the feed by COMM-221, so a name written into it past a
  member's own toggle is written past that toggle permanently with no
  session left to justify it. An admin who wants to know who trained when
  still has `attendance_log`'s staff read policy, which is the surface that
  boundary belongs to.
- **`p_user`'s own `show_attendance` gates the line entirely**, read
  straight off `profiles` — the same direct-column read
  `attendance_classmates_today()` and `attendance_milestones_on_log()` both
  make, and for the same reason: a viewer-relative helper answers true for
  the subject *before* it consults any toggle and therefore literally cannot
  express "has this member opted in at all". Off means `'[]'`,
  indistinguishable from a quiet week, never a raise. It is a reciprocity
  rule (COMM-307's argument, second surface): every member named on a line
  has opted into being seen training, so a member who declined that trade
  does not read the other side of it. `show_attendance` defaults to
  **false**, so out of the box every classmates line is empty and every name
  that ever appears on one is there by two deliberate choices.
  `visible_to_club` is required of candidates but **not** of the subject — a
  member reading their own recap is not being shown to anybody — matching
  `attendance_classmates_today`'s subject gate exactly.
- Errors: `P0001 'recap_weekly_classmates: p_user is required'` for a null
  `p_user`, and nothing else. That is a caller bug rather than a data state,
  and silently writing an empty line would bake it into a stored row where
  nobody would see it; `recap_weekly`'s per-member try/catch turns it into a
  logged failure.
- Side effects: none. `stable`, reads only.

### admin_actions gains one action_type and one target_type label (202609010002)

- `action_type` gains a **thirteenth** value, `'monthly_recap_publish'`
  (202609010001 added the twelfth).
- `target_type` gains an **eleventh**, `'monthly_club_recap'` — the first
  widening of that list since 202608280002. COMM-309 names it explicitly and
  none of the ten existing values fits: the subject of the action is the
  recap row. It is not an `'announcement'` (that table is untouched), not a
  `'post'` (no `workout_posts` row is written), and not the `'club'`.

## Needs from schema, admin analytics dashboard (COMM-310, Phase 3)

Shipped in `202609010006`. **No new table.** Nothing is materialised: every
figure is computed live from `analytics_events` plus the community tables
`docs/community/metrics.md` already names as the cross-check side. A rollup
table would be a second place for WCAM to be defined, and the point of the
WCAM section in `metrics.md` is that there is exactly one definition.

**The metric set is closed.** It is exactly `metrics.md`'s two lists — 5
"Core metrics" + 13 "Additional metrics" = 18 keys — and no more. That file's
own closing note records that its list was reconciled against the shipped
event schema rather than the other way round, so a metric outside those two
lists has no event behind it. `0050` pins both key sets exactly: adding a
metric without adding a line to `metrics.md` fails the suite, and so does
dropping one.

### analytics_wcam_events() returns text[] (202609010006)

- **Purpose.** The 15 `analytics_events.event_name` values that make a member
  ACTIVE for a week under the WCAM definition in `metrics.md` (spec section
  78). **The single server-side copy of that list.**
- Params: none. Returns: `text[]`, the names in `metrics.md`'s own order.
- Auth: `security invoker`, `immutable`. `revoke all from public, anon`;
  **`grant execute to authenticated`** — the one helper here that is
  client-reachable, because the same list already ships to every browser
  inside `src/analytics.js` as `ACTIVE_MEMBER_EVENTS`.
- Side effects: none; reads no data at all.
- **`IMMUTABLE` is load-bearing, not decoration.** It is what lets the planner
  fold `event_name = any(analytics_wcam_events())` to a constant array and
  keep using `analytics_events_name_idx (event_name, created_at desc)`.
  Verified by `explain`; `0050` pins the volatility.
- **Every later WCAM consumer must call this rather than repeat the array.**
  COMM-311 (`member_segments`), COMM-312 (`community_health_scores`) and
  COMM-313 (`retention_cohorts`) are all already specified in terms of
  "WCAM-qualifying activity". There were two copies of this list before this
  migration (`src/analytics.js` and the worked SQL in `metrics.md`) and no
  server-side one; this is now the third and last place it may appear.
- Deliberately absent, and asserted absent by `0050`: the ten passive views
  (`club_tab_viewed`, `feed_viewed`, `post_impression`, `leaderboard_viewed`,
  `challenge_viewed`, `event_viewed`, `weekly_recap_opened`,
  `search_performed`, `directory_opened`, `classmates_card_viewed`),
  `report_submitted`, and `push_opt_in`.

### The four internal helpers (202609010006)

All four are **granted to no role at all** — `revoke all from public, anon,
authenticated`. They are not part of any client contract and are recorded
here only so a later ticket reuses them instead of rewriting them.

- `analytics_week_buckets(p_start date, p_end date) returns table (week_start
  date, week_end date, is_partial boolean)` — `immutable`. Every Monday-based
  ISO week touched by the **inclusive** range, `week_end` exclusive.
  `is_partial` is true when the period does not cover the whole week; such
  weeks are returned and flagged, never dropped, so a month's series is as
  long as the month.
- `analytics_ratio(p_num numeric, p_den numeric) returns numeric` —
  `immutable`. `p_num / p_den` rounded to 4 places, **or NULL when the
  denominator is zero or null.** Every rate in the dashboard goes through it.
- `analytics_event_uuid(p_props jsonb, p_key text) returns uuid` —
  `immutable`. A uuid out of a props blob, or null for anything missing,
  non-string or not uuid-shaped. `analytics_events` takes a direct client
  insert and its props are only size-checked, so a bare `::uuid` cast in a
  dashboard query is one malformed row away from failing the whole call.
- `analytics_breakdown(p_event text, p_prop text, p_from timestamptz, p_to
  timestamptz) returns jsonb` — `stable security definer`. `{prop value:
  count}` for one event name over `[p_from, p_to)`. **Keys truncated to 64
  chars and capped at 25** (largest by count, remainder folded into
  `'(other)'`), because the group key is client-written and otherwise
  unbounded. A missing or empty prop groups under `'(none)'`. Returns `'{}'`
  for no rows, never null. Definer because it reads `analytics_events` past
  RLS **and it takes the event name as a parameter**, so a client-callable
  version would be an unpermissioned reader of the whole analytics stream —
  the grant is the gate, and `auth.uid()` plus the permission are checked one
  level up in `analytics_dashboard()`.

### analytics_dashboard(p_period_start date, p_period_end date) returns jsonb (202609010006)

- **Purpose.** COMM-310's whole dashboard in **one call**, matching
  `coach_celebrate_feed()`'s "one call for the whole list" shape rather than
  one RPC per metric card.
- **Auth.** `security definer`. `auth.uid()` checked first, then
  `has_perm('community.analytics.view') or is_admin()`. Same pair, same
  order, as `recap_monthly_publish()`.
  **This is NOT `is_staff()`, and the difference is the one thing the client
  half must get right.** A coach holds `is_staff()` and does not hold
  `community.analytics.view` (202608280001 seeds it to `admin` and `owner`
  only), so **a coach is refused**. The same coach may preview a monthly
  recap draft and may call `coach_celebrate_feed`. **Gate the nav item on the
  permission, not on staffness**, or a coach is shown a screen the database
  refuses. `0050` asserts exactly that on one session.
- **Why definer, precisely.** *Not* to widen `analytics_events`: that table's
  own select policy already restricts reads to a `community.analytics.view`
  holder (202608280012) and this ticket does not widen it by one row. The
  boundary actually crossed is the cross-check tables — `notifications` and
  `push_subscriptions` are own-row only, `reports` is reporter-or-moderator,
  `attendance_log` is own-row plus staff, and `workout_posts`,
  `post_comments`, `reactions` and `follows` are viewer-relative. Counting any
  of them club-wide from an admin's own session would return that admin's
  slice and label it the club's number.
- **Errors**, all `P0001`: `'not authorized'`, `'period required'` (either
  bound null), `'period end before start'`, `'period exceeds 366 days'`.
- **The period is validated, never clamped**, which is the opposite of
  `coach_celebrate_feed`'s `p_days`. A silently shortened range would put a
  number on screen labelled with a period it was not computed over.
- **`p_period_end` is INCLUSIVE of its day.** `(Mon, Sun)` is that week;
  `(Sep 1, Sep 30)` is September. The resolved half-open bound comes back as
  `period.end_exclusive` so a caller never has to guess.
- **Max lookback 366 days** (inclusive span), per COMM-310's "bounded so a
  pathological range cannot force a full-table scan". 366 rather than 365 so a
  leap year and a this-day-last-year-to-today range both fit.
- Side effects: none. `stable`, reads only.
- **Aggregate only, everywhere.** Every value is a count, a sum or a ratio;
  the only grouping keys are ISO week starts, surface names and enum-shaped
  props. `analytics_breakdown()` is never called with an id-bearing prop
  (`post_id`, `user_id`, `notification_id`, `challenge_id`, `event_id`,
  `member_achievement_id`). `0050` asserts the entire serialised response
  mentions no member id, handle or display name **and contains no uuid of any
  kind in any position** — the jsonb equivalent of the column-list proof
  `monthly_club_recaps` gets for free.

**Response shape.** Four top-level keys, `core`/`additional` grouped to match
`metrics.md`'s own split, which is also the section split the screen renders:

```
{ period: { start, end, end_exclusive, days, weeks },
  generated_at,
  core: { wcam, wcam_share, posting_members, engagement_per_post, feed_reach },
  additional: { open_rate, filter_use, sub_tab_split,
                notification_effectiveness, social_graph_growth,
                challenge_leaderboard_pull, moderation_load,
                share_intent_split, recap_pull_through, discovery_split,
                coach_reach, push_adoption, trained_with_you_reach } }
```

- `core.wcam` / `wcam_share` / `posting_members` / `engagement_per_post` each
  carry a **`weeks` array**, one entry per ISO week, because those four are
  defined *by the week* in `metrics.md`. Each entry carries `partial`.
- `core.wcam.period_active_members` is **not WCAM** and is named so it cannot
  be read as WCAM: distinct actives over the whole period. For a month it is
  larger than any of that month's weeks and is not comparable to one.
- `wcam_share`'s denominator is **membership as of the end of that week** —
  an `invite_redemptions` row redeemed before the week ended on a profile not
  soft-deleted before it ended — not a bare `count(profiles)` today. Carries
  the same known limitation `recap_monthly_generate()` records:
  `grant_coach_role()` updates `redeemed_at`, so promoting a member re-dates
  their join.
- `engagement_per_post` returns the metric from the **event stream** and a
  separate `table_cross_check` from `workout_posts`/`reactions`/
  `post_comments`. The two are *expected* to differ; `metrics.md`'s standing
  rule is "the tables are the cross-check, not the source".
- The thirteen Additional metrics return the **period total** plus a
  `per_week` average where `metrics.md` says "per week". Selecting one week —
  which is how COMM-310 says the screen is driven — makes the two equal.
- Ratios are `null`, not `0`, over a zero denominator. **A count of zero is an
  honest zero; a rate over a zero denominator is not.** Render an em dash.
  Breakdowns are `{}`, never null, and an empty period returns the same 18
  keys as a busy one, so a skeleton card never disappears.

**Four judgment calls made where `metrics.md` under-specifies. Read these
before building a UI label for the number.**

1. **`filter_use.sessions` is a member-day, not a session.** `feed_viewed`
   carries no session id (`post_impression` has `feed_session_id`,
   `feed_viewed` does not), so "the share of sessions that ever change scope"
   is not directly answerable. A "session" is approximated by a `(member,
   calendar day)` pair, and the payload declares this in
   `sessions.basis = "member_day"`. **The number is a floor on the true
   per-session rate, not an estimate of it.** Adding `feed_session_id` to
   `feed_viewed` would answer it exactly and is an additive client prop, not
   a schema change.
2. **`open_rate` types both sides from `workout_posts`, not from the event.**
   `post_impression` has no `post_type` prop, so the denominator must come
   from the post. `post_opened`'s own `post_type` prop is therefore *not*
   used — one source for the grouping key means numerator and denominator
   cannot be typed differently for the same post.
3. **`coach_reach.celebrate_items_eligible` is an upper bound, not a replay.**
   `coach_celebrate_feed()` is viewer-relative (each branch gated by
   `can_view_profile_field()` against the calling coach), clamps to 30 days
   and caps at 100 rows, so what a coach was actually shown cannot be
   recomputed for a past period. This counts what the feed's three *sources*
   produced — PR posts, tenure anniversaries, challenge completions — with the
   same non-privacy filters and without the per-viewer gates. `coverage` is
   therefore a **lower** bound on the share acted on.
4. **`recap_pull_through.open_rate` can legitimately exceed 1.**
   `weekly_recap_opened` also fires with `source = 'account'`, which is a
   member opening the recap with no notification behind it.

**Two behaviours that are deliberately NOT period-bounded**, because they are
facts about *now* and an admin reading a past period still needs them:
`moderation_load.queue.open_now` and
`push_adoption.subscriptions.active_now` / `revoked_now` /
`members_reachable_now`. `0050` asserts the queue depth is non-zero for a
period in which nothing happened, so this cannot be "fixed" into a period
filter by accident.

**Week boundaries are UTC ISO weeks (Monday-based), resolved at the calling
session's TimeZone — UTC for PostgREST.** `metrics.md`'s WCAM section says
"week boundaries follow the club's local week, not UTC". **That is not
implemented here, and it is not implemented anywhere else in this module
either**: `recap_weekly` computes UTC ISO weeks and `recap_monthly_generate()`
recorded the same open question. Pinning a zone in this one function would
make it the only function in the module with an opinion about the club's local
time. **Open item for the planner, module-wide.**

**No new index was added, and there is evidence for that rather than a
shrug.** Every `analytics_events` read in this function filters on
`event_name` first, and `explain` confirms
`analytics_events_name_idx (event_name, created_at desc)` is used for the
15-name WCAM predicate as a single index scan. The cross-check tables are a
different story and are flagged rather than fixed: `notifications`, `reports`,
`follows` and `workout_posts` are each range-scanned on `created_at` with no
index that covers it (`notifications_user_idx` leads with `user_id`,
`workout_posts_feed_idx` is on `published_at`). `recap_monthly_generate()`
already does exactly the same scan on `workout_posts` and shipped without an
index, so this ticket follows that precedent instead of setting a new one.
**If the dashboard gets slow, that is where to look first.**

## Needs from schema, member engagement segmentation (COMM-311, Phase 3)

Shipped in `202609010007`. **No new table, no new policy, no policy edited,
no grant changed on any existing table.** The segmentation is computed live
from three sources that already exist: `analytics_events` (WCAM, always
through `analytics_wcam_events()`), `invite_redemptions` (tenure) and
`coach_engagement_flags` (the `declining` signal).

**There is no second copy of the WCAM event list in this migration.** That is
the reason `analytics_wcam_events()` exists, and `0051` asserts it
structurally: the function body contains the string `analytics_wcam_events`
and does not contain any of the fifteen event names.

### member_segments(p_as_of date default current_date) returns setof jsonb (202609010007)

- **Purpose.** COMM-311's segmentation: one row per club member,
  `{user_id, display_name, handle, segment}`. Exactly the signature and shape
  the ticket's "Client calls and contracts" names.
- **Auth.** `security definer`. `auth.uid()` checked first, then
  `has_perm('community.analytics.view') or is_admin()` — the same pair, in the
  same order, as `analytics_dashboard()`. **Not `is_staff()`: a coach is
  refused.** Gate the nav item on the permission, not on staffness.
- **This is how COMM-311's "never expose a `declining` label to the member it
  describes" is enforced — end to end, not in the UI.** There is **no
  member-facing version of this function at all**, and a plain member holds
  neither the permission nor `is_admin()`, so a member cannot learn their own
  segment by calling it. `0051` proves that on a member who really does carry
  an open flag, and separately proves the same member reads `declining` when
  staff ask.
- **Errors**, both `P0001`: `'not authorized'`, `'as-of date is in the
  future'`. A future date is refused, never clamped, for the same reason
  `analytics_dashboard()` refuses a bad period. A **null `p_as_of` means
  `current_date`** — unlike that function's two bounds, this parameter has a
  sensible default in its own signature.
- Side effects: none. `stable`, reads only. No lookback cap is needed: the
  window is a fixed 8 weeks wherever `p_as_of` points.
- `revoke all from public, anon`; `grant execute to authenticated`.

**The six segments, in strict precedence order.** A member matches the first
branch that is true and appears in exactly one row.

| segment | test |
| --- | --- |
| `new` | redeemed within 30 days of `p_as_of` (join day is day 1, day 30 is the last new day) |
| `declining` | an **open** `coach_engagement_flags` row raised on or before `p_as_of` |
| `highly_active` | WCAM-qualifying in **each** of the last 4 complete ISO weeks |
| `steady` | WCAM-qualifying in at least 4 of the last 8 complete ISO weeks |
| `occasional` | WCAM-qualifying in 1 to 3 of the last 8 |
| `dormant` | WCAM-qualifying in none of the last 8 |

**Two decisions COMM-311 does not make, made here. Read both before building
a UI label.**

1. **`occasional` is a SIXTH bucket this implementation added.** The ticket's
   five are **not exhaustive** — a member active in 1, 2 or 3 of the last 8
   weeks with no flag and more than 30 days of tenure is not `new`, not
   `highly_active`, not `steady`, not `declining`, and *not `dormant` either*,
   because `dormant` is defined as **no** qualifying activity. The first
   acceptance criterion requires every member to land somewhere, so the
   residual is named rather than folded into `dormant`, which would make that
   word false about a member who was in the app three weeks out of eight. The
   output shape is unchanged (`segment` is still one text value), which is the
   "tuned later without a reshaped output" the ticket allows. **To reverse:
   delete one `case` line and `occasional` members fall into `dormant`.**
2. **`declining` outranks `highly_active` and `steady`**, which departs from
   the order the acceptance criteria happen to *list* the buckets in (that
   list is an enumeration of definitions; the ticket states no precedence).
   The flag is a **decline in logged training** computed from
   `attendance_log` (self-reported, never a class check-in — 202609060024);
   WCAM is **app engagement** and can be earned by opening four notifications
   in four weeks. A member who stopped training but still opens the app is
   exactly who this segmentation exists to surface and must not be hidden
   behind `highly_active`. It also keeps the `declining` count equal to the
   open-flag count, so the segment card and COMM-304's Engage section cannot
   show two different numbers for the same thing. **The accepted cost:** a
   flag nobody triages keeps a member in `declining` even after their
   attendance recovers, because `coach_detect_engagement_decline()` does not
   auto-close on recovery. The exit is the dismiss button COMM-304 already
   shipped the write path for.

`new` is above everything, including `declining` — a member in their first 30
days has no baseline to have declined from, and calling a five-day-old member
`dormant` (which their zero activity literally satisfies) is the worst false
positive this function could produce.

**The window is the last 8 COMPLETE Monday-based ISO weeks before `p_as_of`'s
own week. The week in progress is never counted.** Judging a member on a week
that has not finished would make `highly_active` unreachable for six days out
of seven. Same UTC ISO week and the same unresolved "club's local week" gap
`analytics_dashboard()` records.

**Membership is COMM-310's denominator, term for term:** an
`invite_redemptions` row redeemed before the end of `p_as_of`, on a profile
not soft-deleted before the end of `p_as_of`. A profile with no redemption is
not a member and never appears. `invite_redemptions.user_id` is that table's
primary key, so the join cannot duplicate anybody — "exactly one segment per
member" is structural here, not defensive. Carries the same
`grant_coach_role()` re-dates-`redeemed_at` limitation the recap functions
record: promoting a member to coach can put them back into `new` for 30 days.

**`visible_to_club` on the drill-down.** A member with `visible_to_club =
false` is **returned, with their segment, and with `user_id`, `display_name`
and `handle` all null.** Both halves matter:

- the row is present, so the **segment counts are the whole club** and a
  hidden member is not silently deducted from the denominator;
- the row carries no id, no handle and no name, so the drill-down list
  **cannot attribute it to anybody**. All three fields are nulled *together* —
  a bare uuid is still an identifier a staff screen could join against. The
  keys are present-and-null, never absent, so the client renders one row shape.

**This reads the raw `profiles.visible_to_club` column and deliberately does
NOT call `can_view_profile_field()`**, matching
`member_of_week_candidate_set()`'s half of that precedent rather than
`coach_celebrate_feed()`'s. Two reasons specific to this function's gate:
(a) `can_view_profile_field()` returns true for any caller passing
`is_admin()` before it reads the target's toggle, and this function's gate is
`community.analytics.view or is_admin()` — seeded to admin and owner only — so
the helper would be a **no-op** for essentially every legitimate caller;
(b) it returns false across a block edge in either direction, so an admin who
had blocked one member would get a club-wide statistic with that member
missing and every count one short. The redaction here is a fact about the
**member**, applied uniformly, not about who is asking.

**The one viewer-relative thing in the output: `coach_engagement_flags`'
`user_id <> auth.uid()` rule is re-applied by hand**, because definer rights
have already stepped past the policy that carries it. **The caller never reads
their own `declining` label**, including an admin or the owner —
`202608280011` is explicit that the rule covers them. Their row is **not
dropped**: it is still there, under whatever their activity says, so the club
count never differs by one between two staff sessions. `0051` asserts the
mirror pair — the admin and the owner each carry an open flag, each reads the
other as `declining` and themselves as `dormant`, and both runs return the
same 21 members.

A flag must have been **raised** on or before `p_as_of`, but its
**open-ness is a fact about now** — `coach_engagement_flags` has no status
history to reconstruct — the same asymmetry
`analytics_dashboard()`'s `moderation_load.queue.open_now` records.

**Thresholds (30 days, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 4-of-8) are named constants** at the
top of the function body, not client parameters, in COMM-304's tuning-constants
style. `p_as_of` is the only input and it moves the window, never a bar.

**No new index.** Every `analytics_events` read filters on `event_name`
through `analytics_wcam_events()` and so keeps using
`analytics_events_name_idx`; `coach_engagement_flags` is read through
`coach_engagement_flags_open_idx (status, flagged_at desc)`.

## Needs from schema, retention correlation views (COMM-313, Phase 3)

Shipped in `202609010008`. **No new table, no new policy, no policy edited, no
grant changed on any existing table.** All three answers are computed live from
four sources that already exist: `invite_redemptions` (the join month),
`analytics_events` (WCAM, always through `analytics_wcam_events()`),
`onboarding_progress` (the five step stamps) and `member_contact_log` (the
coach Welcome).

**There is no second copy of the WCAM event list in this migration.** `0052`
asserts it structurally across all five functions in the file.

**Build order: this shipped BEFORE COMM-312, which its own "Dependencies" line
names.** That is deliberate. COMM-313 reads nothing COMM-312 produces — its
acceptance criteria and its client contracts never mention
`community_health_scores` or any COMM-312 function, and the only thing it takes
from that ticket is the *wording of the permission gate*. COMM-312, by
contrast, genuinely reads COMM-313: its score names "a retention signal
(COMM-313, once it exists)" as one of four weighted inputs. So the dependency
runs the other way and this is the only order in which either ticket can be
built. The backlog's "COMM-310 through COMM-313, in that order — each later one
reads the one before it" holds for 310 → 311 → 313 and is **wrong for the
312/313 pair**; corrected in `backlog.md` too.

### The gate is `is_admin()` ALONE, and it is narrower than COMM-310's and COMM-311's

All three public functions check `auth.uid()` first, then `is_admin()`, with
**no `has_perm('community.analytics.view')` alternative.** This is not a
copy-paste slip from the two tickets above: COMM-313 says it twice, in its
fifth acceptance criterion ("gated by real `is_admin`, matching COMM-312's
narrower bar rather than the broader `community.analytics.view` bar COMM-310
and COMM-311 use") and again in its client contracts.

Today the two gates select nearly the same people — `202608280001` seeds that
permission to `admin` and `owner` only, and both clear `is_admin()`'s rank bar
of 50. **The difference bites the moment anybody grants that permission one
rank lower**: a `head_coach` or `staff` role holding `community.analytics.view`
reads the dashboard and the segments and is still refused a retention curve.
`0052` asserts exactly that member — it lets them into `member_segments()` on
one line and watches all three functions here refuse them on the next.

**Gate the nav item on `is_admin()`, not on the analytics permission**, or a
head_coach is shown a screen the database refuses.

### retention_cohorts(p_cohort_months integer default 6) returns setof jsonb (202609010008)

- **Purpose.** COMM-313's cohort retention curve. One row per
  `(cohort_month, week_number)`: `{cohort_month, week_number, retained_share,
  member_count}` — exactly the four keys the ticket's contract names.
- **Auth.** `security definer`; `auth.uid()` then `is_admin()` alone. Raises
  `'not authorized'` (`P0001`). `revoke all from public, anon`;
  `grant execute to authenticated`.
- **`p_cohort_months` is CLAMPED to 1..24, not refused** — the opposite of
  `analytics_dashboard()` and `member_segments()`, which both refuse an
  out-of-range period. The ticket says clamp, and it is safe here in a way it
  is not there: **every row names its own `cohort_month`**, so a caller who
  asked for 99 months can see exactly which months answered. A **null means
  6**.
- `cohort_month` is **text**: either `'YYYY-MM'` or the literal `'other'`. A
  real month key can never be the string `other`.
- Side effects: none. `stable`, reads only.

### retention_onboarding_correlation() returns setof jsonb (202609010008)

- One row per `(step, stamped, week_number)`: `{step, stamped, week_number,
  retained_share, member_count}`.
- `step` is the **literal `onboarding_progress` column name** — `welcomed_at`,
  `first_week_shown_at`, `first_month_shown_at` (COMM-222),
  `first_class_shown_at`, `third_class_shown_at` (COMM-316) — so a reader can
  go straight to the column comment that defines when it is stamped.
- `stamped` is `true`/`false`: **was that column ever set**, at any time. It is
  a fact about the row, not a claim about the member; it is deliberately not
  called `saw`, `completed` or `onboarded`.
- **No parameter**, per the ticket's contract, so the 6-month window is a named
  constant a client cannot move. Same auth, same errors, same grants as above.
- **Pooled across cohort months**, not split by month. Splitting would give 5
  steps × 2 groups × 12 weeks × 6 months of cells over the same members, nearly
  all under the floor and therefore suppressed — a real signal turned into an
  empty grid. The cut the ticket asks for is a question about the window.

### retention_welcome_correlation() returns setof jsonb (202609010008)

- One row per `(contacted, week_number)`: `{contacted, week_number,
  retained_share, member_count}`. Same auth, same errors, same grants.
- `contacted` = the member has at least one `member_contact_log` row in the
  **half-open window `[redeemed_at, redeemed_at + 14 days)`**. A contact at the
  join instant counts; one at exactly fourteen days does not.
- **KNOWN PROXY, read this before writing the label.** `member_contact_log`
  (`202608290013`) has **no kind/type/template column** — it is
  `{user_id, contacted_by, contacted_at, note}`, one row per coach outreach of
  any sort. There is no way in this schema to tell a Welcome from any other
  contact, so the fourteen-day window is doing all the work and **a coach who
  logs a scheduling note on day three is counted as a Welcome**. If this ever
  needs to be exact, the fix is a `kind` column on that table, not a heuristic
  on the note text.
- **The exposure window overlaps membership weeks 1 and 2** of the curve it is
  cut against. The curve is left whole rather than starting at week 3 so all
  three surfaces share one x-axis; the caveat belongs in the copy.

### retention_member_weeks(p_months integer) — PRIVATE, granted to no role

The single definition of a membership week, shared by all three public
functions. Returns `{user_id, redeemed_at, cohort_month, week_number, elapsed,
retained}`, **twelve rows per cohort member always**.

**Granted to no role at all — not even `authenticated`.** The grant is the
gate, as it is for `analytics_breakdown()`. It is the only function in the
migration whose result carries a `user_id`, and a client-callable version would
be a per-member retained/churned feed, which is precisely what COMM-313's
fourth acceptance criterion forbids. It carries no auth check of its own; its
three callers check `auth.uid()` and `is_admin()` before calling it. **Do not
grant this to anybody.**

### Four rules that shape every number these three functions return

**1. A membership week is 7×24h from the join instant — NOT an ISO week.** This
is the one place this cluster departs from the ISO grid `analytics_dashboard()`,
`member_segments()` and the recaps all use, and the ticket's own wording forces
it: "the share still WCAM-qualifying in each of *their first 12 weeks of
membership*". A cohort is a calendar month, so its members join on different
days; on an ISO grid a Sunday joiner gets a one-day "week 1" and reads as a
week-1 dropout for a reason that is purely an artefact of the day they signed
up. **Which events count is unchanged** — `analytics_wcam_events()` and nothing
else — only the window boundary moves. Consequence worth knowing: a member
counted active in "membership week 3" here may straddle two ISO weeks in the
dashboard's own WCAM figure. **The two numbers answer different questions and
are not expected to reconcile row for row.** Arithmetic is in seconds so a DST
change cannot resize a week.

**2. A week counts for a member only once it has fully elapsed.** A member who
joined three weeks ago is in no denominator for weeks 4–12. Without this the
chart would measure how long ago people joined, not whether they stayed: a
young cohort gives a **short line**, never a false one, and a cohort whose
members have not finished week 1 returns **nothing at all** rather than twelve
zeroes. `member_count` therefore varies along a line and is monotonically
non-increasing.

**3. The floor is `retention_min_cohort_size()` = 5, and it is applied TWICE.**

- *The ticket's rule:* a cohort month with fewer than 5 members is relabelled
  `'other'` and pooled with every other small month — never drawn as its own
  unstable line, never dropped. The count it is tested against is **how many
  people joined that month**, not how many have lived through week 1, which is
  why the private helper returns non-elapsed weeks too.
- *This implementation's extension:* **a `(group, week)` cell whose denominator
  is below 5 is not emitted at all**, in all three functions. The ticket writes
  only the first rule, but its stated reason — "to avoid a curve built from 1-2
  people" — is just as true of the twelfth point on a line as of the whole
  line, and without it the rule is trivially escapable. **It always truncates
  the tail of a line, never punches a hole in one**, because the denominator
  can only fall as the week number rises. *The cost:* a cohort or a group can
  return no rows at all and the client must render that. **To reverse:** delete
  one `where r.member_count >= v_min` line per function.

`retention_min_cohort_size()` is `immutable`, granted to `authenticated`, so
the client can write its "cohorts under N members are grouped together" caption
without a second copy of the number.

**4. Soft-deleted members STAY in their cohort.** This is a deliberate
departure from COMM-310's denominator, which everything else in this cluster
reuses term for term. That denominator and COMM-311's member universe are both
**snapshots of who the club is**; a cohort is a fixed group fixed at join time,
and **the most churned member of all is the one who deleted their account**.
Dropping them would compute every curve over survivors only and bias every line
upward, worst exactly where staff would most want the truth. A **redemption
with no profile row is excluded** (somebody who redeemed and abandoned the
flow) — every member figure in this module is profile + redemption.
`purge_abandoned_profiles()` cannot remove a cohort member either way: it only
deletes accounts with *no* `invite_redemptions` row. Carries the same
`grant_coach_role()` re-dates-`redeemed_at` limitation the recap functions
record — promoting a member to coach moves them into a later cohort.

### No member is named, anywhere, in any of the three

COMM-313's fourth acceptance criterion is the strictest privacy rule in the
Phase 3 cluster and it is **one step more aggregate than COMM-311**:
`member_segments()` names individuals on purpose (acting on a segment means
knowing who is in it), and these three name nobody at all — **no `user_id`, no
`handle`, no `display_name`, in any output**. "Did this member churn" is a far
more sensitive framing than "which bucket are they in today", and it is not a
question these functions can be asked: the smallest thing they will answer is a
group of five. There is no `visible_to_club` handling here because there is
nothing to hide behind it. `0052` sweeps the entire serialised output of all
three against every profile in the database.

### Correlation, not causation — and what the schema half did about it

The ticket asks that the two cuts be "explicitly not presented as causation
anywhere in the surface's own copy". The copy is the client half's job. What
this half does is refuse to make an honest label hard to write: **there is no
`effect`, `impact`, `lift` or `uplift` key anywhere**, and each cut returns
**two independent curves with no difference computed between them** — a reader
who wants a gap subtracts it themselves, which is the point at which they own
the claim. `0052` asserts the absence of causal key names.

**The substantive caveat, for whoever writes the copy.** An onboarding step is
stamped only when the client **renders** it (`202608290011`: "shown, not merely
scheduled"), which requires the member to open the app. So "was `welcomed_at`
ever stamped" is partly a restatement of "did this member come back at all" —
**the exposure is downstream of the very engagement the curve measures**, and a
gap between the two curves is an upper bound on anything causal, quite possibly
all selection. This is the same point the forward-reference note in "Needs from
schema, admin-moderation (Phase 3)" makes about COMM-316's columns: they record
when a step was *shown*, not when the member's first or third class happened, so
this cut measures **onboarding reach**, not attendance. The Welcome cut has the
same problem in a weaker form: coaches contact the members who are around to be
noticed.

### Two states the client must handle

- **A step nobody has ever been stamped with returns only its `stamped: false`
  group.** Not an empty pair, not a zero row. This is the exact state of both
  COMM-316 columns on the day they deploy — `202609010003` deliberately does not
  backfill them — and **a missing `stamped: true` group must not be rendered as
  "this step is bad for retention"**.
- **A group of four returns nothing at all**, per the floor. Suppression is per
  cell, so one side of a cut can be absent while the other is present.

**No new index, and one honest note about that.** The `analytics_events` read
filters on `event_name` through `analytics_wcam_events()` and so keeps using
`analytics_events_name_idx`; `member_contact_log` is read through
`member_contact_log_user_idx (user_id, contacted_at desc)`;
`onboarding_progress` is read on its primary key. **`invite_redemptions` has no
index on `redeemed_at`** — it has no secondary index at all — so the cohort
window is a sequential scan of that table. That table holds exactly one row per
member, and `member_segments()` and `analytics_dashboard()` already scan it the
same way, so no index is added here for a single-club deployment; it is the
first thing to add if a cohort call ever gets slow.

**Timezone.** `date_trunc('month', ...)` and `to_char()` both resolve at the
calling session's TimeZone — UTC for PostgREST — so a member who joined within
hours of a month boundary can fall in a different cohort than the club's local
calendar would say. The same unresolved "boundaries follow the club's local
week, not UTC" gap `202609010006` and `202609010007` both flag, in its monthly
form.

## Needs from schema, community health score (COMM-312, Phase 3)

Shipped in `202609010009`. **One new table, one policy on it, no policy edited
and no grant changed on any existing table.** Three functions:
`community_health_component()` (private), `community_health_generate()`
(`service_role` only) and `community_health_history()` (`is_admin()` only).
pgTAP `0053`.

**Built AFTER COMM-313, on purpose.** COMM-312's score names "a retention
signal (COMM-313, once it exists)" as one of four weighted inputs, and
COMM-313 reads nothing COMM-312 produces. The ordering correction is recorded
in the COMM-313 section above, in `backlog.md`, and in `202609010008`'s own
header.

### This is the one Phase 3 analytics ticket that STORES its answer

`analytics_dashboard()`, `member_segments()` and the three retention functions
all compute live and materialise nothing, deliberately. COMM-312's third
acceptance criterion asks for the opposite — "the score and its component
breakdown are **stored per computed week**, so a trend line is possible without
recomputing history" — so this one has a table. Two consequences a reader of
that table has to know:

- **A stored score is a snapshot of a judgement, not of the data.** The weights
  are "a reasonable starting split … expected to move" (the ticket's own
  words). When they move, every row already stored was computed under the old
  split. That is why **the weights travel inside `components`** on every row —
  a trend line spanning a weight change can then be seen for what it is instead
  of read as a change in the club. It is also why the client needs no second
  copy of the numbers to label a bar.
- **A recompute of an old week does not reproduce its original score.** See
  "The retention component is as-of-now" below.

### community_health_scores (table)

`{id uuid pk, club_id uuid not null default default_club_id() references
clubs(id), week_start date not null unique, score numeric not null, components
jsonb not null default '{}', computed_at timestamptz not null default now()}` —
the ticket's migration outline exactly, plus **two CHECKs it does not name**:

- `check (extract(isodow from week_start) = 1)`. The same load-bearing
  constraint `weekly_recaps.week_start`, `member_of_week.week_start` and
  `monthly_club_recaps.month_start` all carry. Without it `week_start unique`
  is unique per *date*, not per *week*, and a run keying Monday plus a run
  keying Wednesday both insert with no constraint violation.
- `check (score >= 0 and score <= 100)` and
  `check (jsonb_typeof(components) = 'object')`. Backstops against a writer
  that is not computing a score.

**RLS: exactly one policy**, `community_health_scores_admin_select`, `for
select to authenticated using (public.is_admin())`. **`grant select` to
`authenticated` and nothing else** — no insert, update or delete grant for any
client role and no write policy of any kind, the same shape `pins`,
`attendance_log`, `member_of_week` and `monthly_club_recaps` use. `0053` proves
it three ways: at the grant, at the policy count, and as a refused `insert` /
`update` / `delete` issued by a real **admin** and a real **owner**.

**No second index.** `community_health_history()` reads `order by week_start
desc limit n`, which the unique constraint's own btree serves by scanning
backwards, and the table gains 52 rows a year.

### The gate is `is_admin()` ALONE — narrower than COMM-310 and COMM-311

Same asymmetry COMM-313 built, for the same stated reason. COMM-312: "real
`is_admin` (not merely any `community.analytics.view` holder) is the read gate,
narrower than every other admin dashboard ticket in this phase, since this
figure is interpretive and easy to misread out of context."

`0053` asserts it with the same interesting negative caller `0052` uses: a
`staff`-rank member who really holds `community.analytics.view`, is really let
into `member_segments()` on one line, and on the next reads **zero rows from
the table** and is **refused `community_health_history()`**.

**Gate the nav item on `is_admin()`, not on the analytics permission**, or a
head_coach is shown a screen the database refuses.

### "Internal only" is four structural facts, not four rules

COMM-312's fourth criterion — no score is ever shown to a member, to a coach
without admin rank, or surfaced in any notification, recap or post — holds
because:

1. One policy, `is_admin()`. Not `is_staff()` (so unlike `monthly_club_recaps`,
   a coach cannot even preview), not the analytics permission.
2. No client write grant at all, so no client write path exists to close.
3. **No trigger on the table**, and none of the three functions mentions
   `notif_create`, `workout_posts`, `weekly_recaps`, `monthly_club_recaps` or
   `notifications`. `0053` asserts both.
4. **Not added to the `supabase_realtime` publication**, so `postgres_changes`
   cannot stream a score to a subscriber.

### community_health_generate(p_week_start date default null) returns uuid (202609010009)

- **Purpose.** The "scheduled service-role job" the table's RLS comment refers
  to. Computes and stores **one** ISO week.
- **Auth.** `service_role` only: `revoke all from public, anon, authenticated`,
  `grant execute to service_role`. **No `auth.uid()` check** — the documented
  exception a scheduled job carries in this schema, because there is no session
  to check. The grant *is* the gate, same as `recap_monthly_generate()`,
  `purge_abandoned_profiles()` and `recap_weekly_classmates()`. `0053` proves an
  **admin** calling it directly gets `42501`.
- **`security definer`** for three real crossings: `analytics_events`
  (`community.analytics.view` only), `invite_redemptions` (self-select only),
  and `retention_member_weeks()` (**granted to no role**, so only a definer
  function can call it at all).
- `p_week_start` null means the **most recently completed** ISO week; any other
  date is normalised to the Monday of its own week.
- **A week that has not fully elapsed RAISES `'week has not finished'`
  (`P0001`)**, it is not clamped and not scored partially. Every component is a
  whole-week figure, and because the row is permanent nobody downstream would
  see that a mid-week run's number was partial. `analytics_dashboard()`'s
  validate-and-raise posture, not `retention_cohorts()`' clamp.
- **Returns the row id, or `NULL` when the club had zero members at the end of
  that week** — no row is written. A week before the club existed has no
  community health to measure (WCAM share and the moderation rate are both
  divisions by zero), and storing a zero would put a real-looking low point at
  the left end of every trend line. It is also what makes a backfill loop safe
  to run further back than the club has existed.
- **Idempotent per week: `on conflict (week_start) do update`.** The ticket does
  not use COMM-309's and COMM-314's idempotency wording, but `week_start …
  unique` forces the decision: a plain insert raises `23505` on the second run,
  and a scheduled job that throws on a retry pages somebody every retry. A
  rerun **updates in place, keeps the row's id**, refreshes `computed_at`, and
  over unchanged data reproduces the same score. Unlike `monthly_club_recaps`
  there is **no freeze** — there is no publish step, no member ever sees the
  number, and a recompute is a legitimate act rather than a rewrite of history.
- **No scheduler is built for this function specifically.** 202609050005
  wired a real `pg_cron` schedule for six of this module's periodic
  functions (`recap_monthly_generate()`, `purge_abandoned_profiles()`,
  `coach_detect_engagement_decline()`, `chal_notify_ending_soon()`,
  `notif_batch_flush_due()` and `recap_weekly`), closing that open infra
  item for all of them — but `community_health_generate()` was not among
  the six it covers and remains unscheduled today, same as before: it is
  `service_role`-only with no client grant, reachable only by running it
  by hand as that role, exactly as every other function on this list was
  before 202609050005.
- Side effects: writes `community_health_scores` and nothing else.

### The four components, and exactly where each number comes from

**WCAM is not redefined.** The event list is `analytics_wcam_events()`
(`202609010006`) and there is no array of event names in the file; `0053`
asserts that structurally. (`post_created`, `reaction_added` and
`comment_created` *do* appear — they are metrics.md's own definition of
engagement per post, named the same way `analytics_dashboard()` names them for
the same metric. The assertion checks the nine WCAM-*only* names.)

**Why nothing calls into COMM-310 or COMM-313's public functions.** Not a
performance choice — it is *not possible*. `analytics_dashboard()`,
`member_segments()`, `retention_cohorts()` and both correlations all begin
`v_uid := auth.uid(); if v_uid is null then raise …`. The generator runs from a
scheduler as `service_role`, with no session and no JWT, so every one of them
raises before reading a row. Every public function in this cluster is written
for a logged-in admin, and a cron job is not one.

| Component | Weight | Source | `value` → `sub_score` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `wcam_share` | **0.40** | recomputed here from `analytics_wcam_events()` + COMM-310's membership denominator | the share itself, clamped into 0..1 |
| `engagement_per_post` | **0.25** | recomputed here from the event stream, metrics.md's definition | `value / 3.0`, clamped at 1 |
| `retention` | **0.25** | **`retention_member_weeks(6)`**, COMM-313's private helper | the share itself |
| `moderation_load` | **0.10** | the `reports` **table** | `1 − value / 10.0`, floored at 0 — **inverse** |

- **WCAM share** — numerator `count(distinct user_id)` over
  `analytics_wcam_events()` inside the week with `user_id is not null`;
  denominator **club membership as of the end of the week** (a redemption
  before the week ended on a profile not soft-deleted before the week ended).
  That is COMM-310's `actives` and `members` CTEs for a single bucket, term for
  term. Note it is **not** COMM-313's cohort denominator, which deliberately
  keeps soft-deleted members — a weekly share is a snapshot of who the club
  *is*. Clamped at 1 because the numerator can include someone who was active
  on Tuesday and deleted on Thursday.
- **Engagement per post** — `(reaction_added + comment_created) / post_created`
  inside the week, events on both sides, exactly as metrics.md writes it.
  COMM-310's `workout_posts`/`reactions`/`post_comments` cross-check is a
  data-quality tool for a human reading a dashboard, not a second definition,
  and is deliberately **not** folded into the score.
- **Moderation load** — the **`reports` table**, not the `report_submitted`
  event, taking the other side of COMM-310's own distinction ("the event side
  is what members *did*; the reports side is what the club has to act on").
  Load is what the club has to act on, and the table is authoritative: an
  analytics event can be dropped by an ad blocker, and *a safety signal that
  quietly improves when telemetry breaks* is the worst failure mode available.
  Rows **created in** the week, not "open during" it — `reports` has no status
  history, the same asymmetry `analytics_dashboard()`'s `queue.open_now`
  records.
- **Retention** — see below.

**The two normalisation constants are as much a judgement as the weights** and
are named in the same place, and both are carried into the stored row:

- **3.0 interactions per post** for full engagement marks. metrics.md defines
  the metric and sets no target. Three reactions-plus-comments on a typical
  post is the difference between a feed where posting gets you a response and
  one where it does not; one is a courtesy, ten is a different kind of club.
- **10.0 reports per 100 members per week** scores zero on moderation. A
  **rate**, not a raw count, so a club that doubles in size is not penalised for
  the reports that come with it. Ten per hundred is one report per ten members
  in a single week — a week the club would already know about.

### The weights, and why this split

Named constants at the top of `community_health_generate()`'s body, per the
ticket's validation rules. **`0053` asserts they sum to 1.00 from the stored
row**, not from the source, so an edit that changes one and forgets another
cannot pass quietly.

- **WCAM share 0.40**, the largest single weight: metrics.md's first core
  metric and the one figure that most directly answers "is the community layer
  being used at all". Everything else is a quality or safety signal on top of
  it.
- **Engagement 0.25 + retention 0.25 = 0.50**, deliberately *more* than WCAM on
  its own. A week where lots of members opened a feed and nothing they posted
  got a response, or where activity is high because new members keep arriving
  and leaving, is not a healthy week, and a split that let raw reach carry the
  score would call it one.
- **Moderation 0.10**, the smallest and deliberately not zero. It is a penalty
  signal with a tiny natural range — a healthy club sits at the top of it
  permanently — so a larger weight would be ten free points most weeks, while
  0.10 still lets a real moderation crisis take a visible ten points off.

**This is a starting split and it is expected to move.** Nothing in this repo
grounds a different one; it is a judgement recorded, not a measurement.

### The retention signal: which COMM-313 output, and its one sharp limitation

**`retention_member_weeks(6)`, the private helper** — the only one of
`202609010008`'s functions a service-role job can call, since the other three
raise on a null `auth.uid()`. Its contract entry already says a definer
function is the only thing that can call it and that its callers must gate
first; this is that caller, and its gate is the `service_role` grant.

**The scalar: the pooled week-4 retained share** — `count(retained) / count(*)`
over rows where `week_number = 4 and elapsed`, across every cohort in the
6-month window.

- **Week 4**, because week 1 is close to a restatement of "did they open the
  app the week they signed up" and week 12 exists only for members who joined
  84+ days ago, which would exclude the two most recent cohort months and lag
  the score by a quarter.
- **Pooled, not per-cohort.** This number lands in a *weekly* series, and a
  five-person cohort denominator moves in 20-point steps for reasons that have
  nothing to do with the week being scored. Pooling gives the largest
  denominator COMM-313's own default window supports. Pooling includes months
  COMM-313 would have folded into `'other'` — folding only matters when months
  are drawn as separate lines.
- **The floor is `retention_min_cohort_size()` = 5**, COMM-313's constant
  reused rather than a second minimum invented, applied to the **pooled**
  denominator. Below it the component is **unavailable, not zero**.

**THE RETENTION COMPONENT IS MEASURED AS OF THE RUN, NOT AS OF THE SCORED
WEEK.** `retention_member_weeks()` is anchored on `now()` — its cohort window
ends with the month in progress and its `elapsed` flag is relative to the
current instant — and it takes no as-of parameter. Consequences:

- For the intended use (the scheduler runs once, days after a week ends) the
  two instants are close enough that the distinction is academic.
- **For a backfill it is not.** Generating twelve weeks in one run gives all
  twelve rows the *same* retention component, today's. The chart then shows
  three components moving and one flat, which is an artefact of the backfill
  and not a fact about the club. `0053` asserts exactly this: two different
  weeks generated in the same run carry an identical retention value.
- **A recompute of an old week does not reproduce its original score**, even
  with no new data for that week. `computed_at` is refreshed on every write and
  `components.retention.detail.as_of` / `.as_of_basis`
  (`'run_time_not_week_end'`) record it inside the breakdown.

**Not fixed here, and the fix is not small.** An as-of-correct signal means a
second copy of COMM-313's membership-week arithmetic parameterised on a date —
exactly the duplication `202609010008` was written to prevent. The right fix is
an **as-of parameter on `retention_member_weeks()` itself**, in COMM-313's
file. Open item.

### A component with no data drops out, and the rest are RENORMALISED

`engagement_per_post` is **null**, not zero, in a week with no posts. That is
`analytics_ratio()`'s rule applied to a component ("a count of zero is an
honest zero, a *rate* over a zero denominator is not"): with nothing posted
there is nothing to measure, and scoring it 0 would double-penalise a quiet
week the WCAM component has already scored as quiet.

The score is a **weighted mean over the available components**, not a weighted
sum over all four: an unavailable component contributes to neither the
numerator nor the denominator, so its weight is redistributed proportionally
and the score stays on the same 0..100 scale.

**The cost, stated:** a week scored on two components does not announce that on
its face. It announces it *in the row* — every component carries
`weight_applied`, which is `0` for the ones that dropped out, and
`components.weight_total_applied` is the surviving total. **A client showing a
score whose `weight_applied` values do not cover all four should say so.**

`moderation_load` is available whenever the club has a member, which the
zero-member early return guarantees, so the score is always computable.

### community_health_history(p_weeks integer default 12) returns setof jsonb (202609010009)

- **Purpose.** COMM-312's client contract, signature for signature. One row per
  stored week: `{week_start, score, components}` — **exactly three keys**. The
  row's `id`, `club_id` and `computed_at` are in the table and deliberately not
  in the contract.
- **Auth.** `security definer`; `auth.uid()` first, then **`is_admin()` alone**.
  Raises `'not authorized'` (`P0001`). `revoke all from public, anon`;
  `grant execute to authenticated`.
- **`p_weeks` CLAMPS to 1..52** (null means 12), not refused — the ticket's
  validation rules say clamp, and it is safe for `retention_cohorts()`' reason:
  every row names its own `week_start`, so a clamped answer cannot be mistaken
  for the one asked for.
- **Returns the NEWEST `p_weeks` weeks, ordered OLDEST FIRST** so a trend line
  draws left to right. The limit is applied to a descending subquery before the
  ascending sort; `order by week_start limit 12` would have returned the twelve
  *oldest* weeks.
- **Returns 0 or 1 rows happily.** COMM-312's empty state is "fewer than 2
  computed weeks shows the latest score with no trend line rather than a broken
  chart" — nothing is fabricated to fill a chart, and the decision is the
  client's.
- **The `definer` bit crosses nothing today**, and that is stated rather than
  dressed up: the table's only policy is the same `is_admin()` test the
  function performs. It is `definer` because the ticket specifies it and
  because it makes this gate independent of the table's rather than derived
  from it. `0053` asserts both halves separately so they cannot drift apart.
- Side effects: none. `stable`, reads only. **This is the only read path** —
  there is no member-facing and no general-staff surface for this figure
  anywhere.

### community_health_component(...) — PRIVATE, granted to no role

`community_health_component(p_value numeric, p_sub_score numeric, p_weight
numeric, p_weight_total numeric, p_detail jsonb) returns jsonb`. `immutable`,
pure, reads nothing. Builds one component as `{value, sub_score, weight,
weight_applied, detail}` so all four carry an identical key set and cannot
drift apart, and so the renormalisation rule (`weight / weight_total`, or `0`
when `sub_score` is null) lives in one place. **Granted to no role at all** —
it is an implementation detail of the generator, and a client-callable version
would be a second way to mint something that looks like a stored component.

### The `components` blob names no member

`components` is free-form `jsonb`, so unlike `monthly_club_recaps` the *table
shape* cannot enforce aggregate-only. The rule is enforced by what the
generator puts there: **every leaf is a count, a ratio or a named constant**,
and there is no `user_id`, handle, `display_name`, `post_id` or `report_id`
anywhere. `0053` walks every leaf of every stored row *and* of every
`community_health_history()` row and sweeps it against every profile in the
database — the same sweep `0046`, `0050` and `0052` make — plus a separate
check that no *key* is even shaped like an identifier.

**Do not add a `top_poster`, a `worst_offender` or a `members_who_churned` key
here.** One naming consequence worth knowing: the retention breakdown's
denominator is called **`cohort_size`, not `member_count`**, because the string
`member_count` contains the `rls_helpers` handle `member_c` as a substring and
`0052` already lost time to exactly that.

**Blob shape**, pinned by `0053`: nine top-level keys — `version`,
`week_start`, `week_end_exclusive`, `club_members`, `weight_total_applied`, and
the four components — each component five keys, and **nothing nested deeper
than three levels** (top → component → detail), which is what makes the leaf
walk complete rather than merely convenient.

**Timezone.** `date_trunc('week', …)` is Monday-based and resolves at the
calling session's TimeZone — UTC for the scheduler. The same unresolved "week
boundaries follow the club's local week, not UTC" gap `202609010006`,
`202609010007` and `202609010008` all flag.

## Edge Functions

### recap_weekly

- Schedule: weekly. Idempotent per user per week via the unique `(user_id,
  week_start)` key on `weekly_recaps` (see "Needs from schema, recaps").
  Phase 2, COMM-220. `week_start` must be the ISO week's Monday; a CHECK
  rejects anything else, so a run that computes a Sunday-start week fails
  loudly rather than silently double-inserting.
- Output: one `weekly_recaps` row per active user, plus one `notif_create(U,
  'weekly_recap', 'club', ...)` call per user with a deep link to the recap
  surface (COMM-221), matching the routing table entry above.
- Records success and failure counts with no personal content.
- Shipped in `supabase/functions/recap_weekly/index.ts`, the first Edge
  Function in this repo. "Active member" for this function's purposes means
  a non-deleted profile with an `invite_redemptions` row - deliberately not
  WCAM (which answers "did something this week", the opposite of the
  members a quiet-week recap exists for). Only ever notifies for a row that
  did not already exist before that run (checked before the upsert, since
  after the upsert a first run and a rerun are indistinguishable).
- **Auth: explicit service-role check inside the function body, not just
  the platform's default `verify_jwt`.** `verify_jwt` only proves the caller
  presented some valid JWT - the public anon key already shipped in
  `cloud-config.js` satisfies that as well as the real service role key
  does, which is not this function's intent (it runs as service role and
  touches every member's data). The handler compares the `Authorization`
  header against `Bearer <service role key>` directly and returns 401
  otherwise. Verified locally: an anon-key call and a no-header call both
  get 401, a service-role-key call gets 200 with the expected
  `{weekStart, weekEnd, success, failure, total}` shape. The weekly
  cron/schedule itself (what actually calls this with the service role key,
  and how that key reaches the caller without living in a client bundle)
  remains the same open infra item the notification batch flusher already
  has - not built here.
- ~~**COMM-316, the classmates line — schema side shipped, Edge Function side
  OPEN.**~~ — **SHIPPED, client half.** `computeClassmates()` in
  `supabase/functions/recap_weekly/index.ts` calls
  `supabase.rpc('recap_weekly_classmates', { p_user: userId, p_week_start:
  weekStart })` inside `buildRecapFields()`'s existing `Promise.all`, and the
  returned array lands on the upsert as `classmates` verbatim (a null/error
  response is normalised to `[]` before it reaches the row, never dropped —
  `classmates` is `not null`). It reuses the per-member `try`/`catch` already
  in `generateRecaps()`'s loop rather than adding a second one, per
  202609010003's own comment ("recap_weekly's per-member try/catch only ever
  sees a genuine fault"). No TypeScript re-implementation of the privacy gate
  was added — the RPC is the only source, exactly as prescribed below.
  `p_week_start: weekStart` is passed explicitly, the same `targetWeek()`
  value every other figure in the row is keyed off. The notification body is
  unchanged — naming a classmate in a push notification was never in scope,
  since the argument that permits the line depends entirely on
  `weekly_recaps`' own-row RLS and a notification body is a different
  surface. The client render is `cloud.js`'s `renderRecapBody()`: a labelled
  line under "מי עוד התאמן איתכם השבוע", each name a `view-profile` link,
  rendered in the order the row already carries (no client re-sort). An
  empty array renders a quiet-week message (`data-recap-classmates="empty"`)
  rather than being omitted — the recaps agent's own call, made for
  consistency with every other section of this exact function (PRs,
  achievements, challenge progress, the upcoming event), which already
  render an `.empty` line instead of disappearing. Covered by
  `test/community-recaps.test.mjs`. **Gap, stated rather than papered over:
  `recap_weekly/index.ts` itself has no executing test coverage anywhere in
  this repo** — it is the only Edge Function that exists, there is no
  Deno/Node harness for it, and `computeClassmates()`/the per-member
  try/catch wiring is therefore verified by code inspection against
  202609010003's contract, not by a running test. The original notes for
  whoever wrote this, kept for the record:
  - The RPC returns the **array itself**, so `data` goes straight onto the
    row; there is no `.map()` and no shape to rebuild.
  - **Do not compute the line in TypeScript.** The privacy gate — block
    edges both ways, deleted profiles, `visible_to_club`, the candidate's
    `show_attendance` and the subject's own `show_attendance` — lives in the
    function precisely so it does not exist in two languages, and the
    service-role client bypasses RLS, so a hand-rolled query would have no
    gate at all.

### ~~recap_monthly_club~~ — NOT BUILT AS AN EDGE FUNCTION

- ~~Schedule: monthly. Admin preview before publish. Phase 3, COMM-309.
  Output: aggregate club figures, no member names in public sections.~~
- **Superseded by `public.recap_monthly_generate(date)` in 202609010002.**
  COMM-309 shipped with generation as a service-role-only Postgres function
  rather than a second Edge Function; the full reasoning is in **"## Needs
  from schema, monthly club recap (COMM-309, Phase 3)"** above, under "The
  generation-mechanism decision". Read that, not this. Everything this stub
  promised shipped — the monthly schedule slot, the draft/preview/publish
  shape, aggregate-only output — with the mechanism changed and one
  consequence: there is no `supabase/functions/recap_monthly/` directory and
  there never will be under this ticket. `recap_weekly` remains the only
  Edge Function in the repo.

### purge_abandoned_profiles — SHIPPED

- Schedule: daily. Now scheduled by 202609050005:
  `cron.schedule('purge-abandoned-profiles', '31 3 * * *', ...)` — 03:31
  UTC daily (see below for the history of this being unscheduled).
  Versioned. Idempotent.
  Phase 3, COMM-314. Shipped as
  `supabase/functions/purge_abandoned_profiles/index.ts`, calling
  `public.purge_abandoned_profiles(p_retention_days integer default 30)`
  in `202609010004`.
- Purpose: remove abandoned anonymous profiles per the retention rule.
  Retention window confirmed 2026-08-31: **30 days**, matching
  `purge_due_accounts()`'s own window.
- Records success and failure counts with no personal content:
  `{checked, success, failure}`, plus `version`/`retention_days`/`ran_at`
  added by the Edge Function wrapper.
- Not the same job as the already-shipped `purge_due_accounts()`
  (202608260001, a member's own explicit deletion request purged 30 days
  after they ask). "Abandoned" here means `auth.users.is_anonymous = true`,
  no `invite_redemptions` row, no `profiles.recovery_verified_at` — both
  genuinely absent, not merely old — older than the retention window.
- **One deviation from this stub's own wording, recorded here because the
  stub said "reads `auth.users`, `invite_redemptions`, `profiles`
  directly [from the Edge Function]" and that is not actually reachable:**
  `supabase/config.toml`'s `[api] schemas = ["public", "graphql_public"]`
  is what PostgREST exposes to any caller, service-role key included —
  the service-role key bypasses RLS on exposed tables, it does not add
  `auth.users` to the exposed schema list, so there is no
  `supabase.from("auth.users")` reachable from the Edge Function's JS
  client. The Edge Function still exists at the path the ticket named and
  still carries the explicit `Authorization: Bearer <service role key>`
  check `recap_weekly` established, but its own body does no direct table
  reads at all — it calls `public.purge_abandoned_profiles()` over RPC,
  the same shape `recap_weekly` already uses for
  `recap_weekly_classmates()` for its own server-side-only logic. Full
  reasoning in the migration's own header comment
  (`202609010004_purge_abandoned_profiles.sql`).
- Deletion mechanism matches `purge_due_accounts()` exactly: a raw SQL
  `delete from auth.users` inside a SECURITY DEFINER function relying on
  the same `on delete cascade` FK shape, not the Admin API — one
  difference, it deletes one candidate at a time inside its own exception
  block (rather than one bulk statement) so "success and failure counts"
  is a real per-account signal.
- pgTAP coverage: `supabase/tests/0048_purge_abandoned_profiles_test.sql`.
  No test coverage exists for the Edge Function wrapper itself — same gap
  `recap_weekly`'s own `index.ts` already has; see the runbook's "Open
  questions and gaps".
- Runbook: `docs/community/abandoned-profile-purge-runbook.md` (not the
  `attendance-purge-runbook.md` path this stub originally suggested — see
  that file's own header for why the name changed).
- **Now scheduled** — 202609050005 closed this open infra item for this
  function and for `recap_weekly`, `notif_batch_flush_due()`,
  `chal_notify_ending_soon()`, `coach_detect_engagement_decline()` and
  `recap_monthly_generate()` all together, in one migration.

## Phase 3 forward contracts (not yet built)

Every function below is named by a Phase 3 ticket in
`docs/community/tickets/` and recorded here before it is built, per this
file's own standing rule. None of these exist in a migration yet. All of
them are additive to an existing signature (`feed_page`, `feed_leaderboard`,
`people_suggestions`, `community_profile`, `consistency_week_streaks`) or
are brand new — no existing signature is narrowed by any entry here.

### Needs from schema, attendance foundation (Phase 3) — SHIPPED

COMM-300, the prerequisite for everything else in this section, shipped in
202608310001. It is no longer a forward reference: the built contract, with
the parts that differ from what was promised here, is
**"## Needs from schema, attendance (COMM-300, Phase 3)"** above. Read that,
not this.

What a dependent ticket needs to know changed between the two:

- Everything promised here shipped as promised. The table columns, the
  unique key, the RLS shape, the trigger's timing and filter, the emit and
  the analytics wiring are all exactly as written above.
- Two helper functions were added that were not named here and that a
  dependent ticket should reuse rather than re-derive:
  `attendance_session_record_types() returns text[]` (the session-bearing
  set, currently `{strength_entry, wod_entry}`) and
  `attendance_parse_day(p_raw text) returns date` (the null-on-anything-bad
  payload date parser).
- The future-date rule resolved to **refuse the attendance row, never clamp**,
  with one day of slack for the UTC-vs-local-calendar-day gap.
- The migration backfills existing `private_records`, which was not in the
  outline. Members therefore have real attendance history from day one
  rather than starting at zero.
- The staff/analytics select policy is **not** gated on
  `can_view_profile_field(user_id, 'show_attendance')`. Every member-facing
  reader (COMM-302, COMM-306, COMM-307) applies that toggle in its own body.

### Needs from schema, feed (Phase 3)

- ~~`relationship_score(p_viewer uuid, p_other uuid) returns numeric`~~ —
  **SHIPPED in 202608310002, COMM-301.** No longer a forward reference: the
  built contract is **"### relationship_score(p_viewer uuid, p_other uuid,
  p_as_of timestamptz default now()) returns numeric"** under `## Feed`
  above. Read that, not this. It shipped as promised — same purpose, same
  numbers, `security invoker`, no grant to any role — with one addition: a
  third, defaulted `p_as_of` parameter carrying the window anchor, so the
  two-argument call form above still resolves and a caller with a frozen
  session anchor keeps the same 30-day boundary across every page. A
  dependent ticket that has an anchor should pass it.
- ~~`feed_page(cursor, limit, scope)` re-created: `v_class_connection` stops
  being hard-0'd~~ and ~~`people_suggestions(p_limit)` re-created: one more
  UNION ALL branch~~ — **both SHIPPED in 202608310003, COMM-302, closing
  COMM-P01.** No longer forward references: the built contracts are
  **"### feed_page(...)"** and **"### people_suggestions(...)"** under
  `## Feed` above. Read those, not this. Both shipped as promised — same
  signatures, `v_class_connection` computed from `attendance_log` overlap in
  a trailing 60-day window gated by `can_view_profile_field(author,
  'show_attendance')`, one more UNION ALL branch, one more `scored` column,
  one more `signals` key `shared_classmate_days`, `reason` gaining
  `'classmate'`, priority order challenge, classmate, interaction, event —
  with one addition this section did not name:
- `classmate_day_counts(p_as_of timestamptz default now()) returns
  table(user_id uuid, shared_days integer)` — new, internal, `security
  invoker`, no grant to any role. COMM-302's own migration outline named only
  the two re-creations; this helper exists because both of them need the same
  window, the same overlap count and the same `show_attendance` gate, and the
  privacy gate in particular is the last thing that should exist twice. Full
  contract under `## Feed` above. A dependent ticket (COMM-303, COMM-307)
  should reuse it rather than re-derive the overlap.
- ~~`consistency_week_streaks()` re-created: body reads `attendance_log`
  instead of `workout_posts`~~ and ~~`community_profile(user_id uuid)`
  re-created: `current_streak`'s inline copy updated to match~~ — **both
  SHIPPED in 202608310004, COMM-306, closing COMM-P02.** No longer forward
  references: the built contracts are **"### consistency_week_streaks()"**,
  **"### feed_leaderboard(...)"** and **"### community_profile(...)"** above.
  Read those, not this. Both shipped as promised — same signatures, same
  arithmetic, one table swapped, and `feed_leaderboard`'s consistency filter
  gaining `can_view_profile_field(member, 'show_attendance')` so an opted-out
  member is absent from the ranked set rather than ranked at 0 — with one
  addition this section did not name: `community_profile`'s `current_streak`
  key is gated on `show_attendance` in addition to `show_workout_results`. The
  number is attendance-derived now, so it may not travel past attendance's own
  toggle (202608310001's standing rule for every member-facing Phase 3
  reader), and without it a member would be absent from the board and
  published on their profile in the same breath. `training_frequency` and
  `recent_workouts` are untouched and still read `workout_posts` under
  `show_workout_results` alone.
- ~~`attendance_classmates_today() returns setof jsonb`,
  `{user_id, display_name, handle, avatar_url}` — `security definer`, same
  boundary-crossing shape as `people_suggestions`. Distinct from COMM-302's
  signal: "today" only, no window, no historical count.~~ — **SHIPPED in
  202608310005, COMM-307's schema half, closing COMM-P05.** No longer a
  forward reference: the built contract is
  **"### attendance_classmates_today(p_limit int default 6) returns setof
  jsonb"** under `## Feed` above. Read that, not this. It shipped as promised —
  same returned shape, same four keys, `security definer`, today only with no
  window and no count, `can_view_profile_field(candidate, 'show_attendance')`
  and block edges in either direction — with two additions this section did
  not name:
  - **A defaulted `p_limit int default 6`, clamped 1..20.** COMM-307's own
    "validation rules and limits" asked for it ("matching
    `people_suggestions`'s own limit shape, clamp 1..20, default a smaller
    number appropriate to a card"); the zero-argument call form promised here
    still resolves verbatim, the same accommodation COMM-301's `p_as_of` made.
  - **The caller's own `show_attendance` is enforced inside the function**, as
    a direct `profiles` column read rather than through
    `can_view_profile_field` (which answers true for the caller before reading
    any toggle and so could not express the question). Off means an empty set,
    never a raise. COMM-307's acceptance criteria stated the behaviour but not
    where it lives; it lives server-side because every boundary in this module
    does. Full reasoning in the contract above.
  - ~~**Still open: COMM-307's client half.**~~ — **also SHIPPED**, in the
    same ticket: the feed-top card in COMM-115's slot, the follow action
    reusing `follow()` (COMM-230) and the `classmates_card_viewed` event with
    its `metrics.md` row. The built contract for it is the last bullet of
    "### attendance_classmates_today(p_limit int default 6) returns setof
    jsonb" above.
- ~~`member_feed_weights(user_id uuid pk, weights jsonb not null default
  '{}', computed_at timestamptz not null default now())` — own-row select
  only, no client write grant. `feed_page` re-created again to read it and
  fall back to today's fixed defaults when absent.~~ — **SHIPPED in
  202608310006, COMM-303.** No longer a forward reference: the built contracts
  are **"### member_feed_weights (table)"**, **"### feed_weights_resolve(...)"**
  and **"### recompute_feed_weights(...)"** under `## Feed` above, plus the
  third re-creation bullet on **"### feed_page(...)"**. Read those, not this.
  It shipped as promised — three columns, own-row select only, no client write
  grant of any kind, `feed_page` falling back to the fixed defaults when the
  row is absent — with three things this section did not name:
  - **`feed_weights_resolve(p_user uuid, p_defaults jsonb) returns jsonb`**,
    new, internal, `security invoker`, no grant to any role. The
    redistribution arithmetic, extracted so it has a name the pgTAP file can
    assert invariants against. It takes the defaults as a parameter so the
    eight numbers stay stated once, in `feed_page`'s weight block.
  - **`recompute_feed_weights(p_limit integer default 500)` is a deliberate
    no-op.** COMM-303's outline names the function; the ticket puts the
    derivation out of scope. The signature, grants and auth boundary ship; the
    body does not. **The actual weight-derivation algorithm from
    `feed_interactions` history is NOT built**, so today every member has no
    row and every member gets the fixed defaults. This is the "storage exists,
    computation does not" shape, not a finished personalization feature.
  - **The two tuning numbers the ticket flagged are resolved**: clamp bounds
    0.40..2.50 of each component's default, recomputation cadence weekly. Both
    are revisable; the cadence lives only in a commented cron line.
  - And one correction rather than an addition: **the weight block's "sum to
    104" was stale since COMM-302 and reads 110 now.** No weight moved.

### Needs from schema, achievements (Phase 3)

- ~~`update achievement_definitions set enabled = true where trigger_type =
  'ATTENDANCE_RECORDED'`~~ and ~~one security-definer AFTER INSERT trigger on
  `attendance_log`: computes the member's total distinct days and current
  streak, inserts a `member_achievements` row on a genuine crossing (1, 25,
  100 days; a fresh 4-week streak for the repeatable code), and, for the two
  count milestones only, an authorless `POST_ATTENDANCE_MILESTONE` post gated
  by the member's own `show_attendance`~~ — **both SHIPPED in 202608310007,
  COMM-305, closing COMM-P03.** No longer forward references: the built
  contract is **"## Needs from schema, attendance achievements (COMM-305,
  Phase 3)"** above. Read that, not this. Everything promised here shipped as
  promised — the `UPDATE`, the trigger, the crossing rule, the two count
  milestones posting and the first class not, the `show_attendance` gate on
  the post and not on the achievement, the `workout_posts`-is-the-record
  idempotency, `club` visibility, `ach_claim`'s refusal untouched, and the
  generic `ach_evaluate` deliberately not built — with four things this
  section did not name:
  - **`attendance_week_streak(p_user uuid, p_exclude_day date default null)
    returns integer`**, new, internal, `security invoker`, no grant to any
    role. The outline named no helper; this one exists because the repeatable
    code has to know what the streak was *before* the row that just landed,
    which `consistency_week_streaks()` is set-wide and zero-argument and
    cannot answer. Same arithmetic, pinned against it for every member by
    0043 so the two cannot drift.
  - **The count milestones test state, not a delta.** "Reaches the threshold
    and does not already hold the code", decided by
    `member_achievements_once_idx`. A literal just-crossed delta silently
    awards nothing for any multi-row insert. Full reasoning in the contract
    above; the repeatable streak still tests a genuine before/after crossing,
    because a repeat cannot be answered from state.
  - **`metadata` carries a third key, `member_id`**, beyond the two the Phase
    1 client contract fixed. The renderer ignores it; the "already posted this
    milestone" guard needs it, since the rule is "that member and that count".
  - **The `show_attendance` gate is a write-time gate**, read once at the
    unlock and never re-asked, so turning the toggle on later does not
    retro-publish a milestone crossed while it was off.

### Needs from schema, coach-tools (Phase 3)

- `coach_detect_engagement_decline()` — service-role only, same auth shape
  as `chal_notify_ending_soon()`. Reads `attendance_log`, writes
  `coach_engagement_flags` (empty since 202608280011). COMM-304, closing
  COMM-P04. Flips COMM-226's `state.featureFlags.coachEngage` to
  default-on.
- ~~`member_of_week(...)` table, own-row-free (club-wide select once
  published), no client write grant. `member_of_week_candidates(p_week_start)`
  and `member_of_week_publish(p_week_start, p_user_id, p_reason)`, both
  `security definer`, staff-gated. COMM-315 — flagged as an open question
  in its own ticket file, category set not spec-grounded.~~ — **SHIPPED in
  202609010001, COMM-315.** No longer a forward reference: the built
  contract is **"## Needs from schema, member of the week (COMM-315, Phase
  3)"** above. Read that, not this. Everything promised here shipped as
  promised — the table, its club-wide select, its total absence of a client
  write path, and both staff-gated definer functions with the exact
  signatures named — with five things this line did not name:
  - **`member_of_week_category(date)` and `member_of_week_category_label(text)`**,
    two new immutable helpers. The rotation rule had to live in exactly one
    place because both entry points consult it, and the index is *weeks since
    a fixed epoch Monday mod 4*, not the ISO week number, which repeats a
    category across every 53-week ISO year.
  - **`member_of_week_candidate_set(text, date, int)`**, internal, no grant
    to any role, so publish and candidates ask the shortlist question from
    one copy.
  - **The category is derived at publish, not passed.** Publishing somebody
    the week's shortlist did not contain *is* a coach's pick and is recorded
    as one — which is how the ticket's "staff can fall back to coach's pick"
    empty state works with the fixed three-parameter signature.
  - **Two refusals beyond the two the ticket names**: an empty reason on a
    coach's pick, and a member whose `visible_to_club` is false. Relatedly,
    every candidate toggle is read from the **raw column** as well as through
    `can_view_profile_field()`, because that helper short-circuits to true
    for an admin — publishing is broadcasting, and an admin's rank must not
    override a member's own choice.
  - **`admin_actions.action_type` gained `'member_of_week_publish'`**, the
    first widening of that closed list since 202608280002.

### Needs from schema, challenges (Phase 3)

- ~~`challenge_teams` gains `captain_id uuid references profiles(id) on
  delete set null`.~~
- ~~`chal_reassign_team(p_challenge_id, p_user_id, p_team_id)` and
  `chal_set_captain(p_team_id, p_user_id)`, both `security definer`,
  `community.challenge.create` gated, both writing `admin_actions`.
  COMM-308.~~ — **SHIPPED in 202609010005, COMM-308.** No longer a forward
  reference: the built contract is **"## Challenge team management
  (COMM-308)"** above, under "## Challenges". Read that, not this. The
  column, both signatures, both gates and both audit rows shipped exactly as
  promised, with four things this line did not anticipate:
  - **`challenge_participants_update_self` did not already restrict
    `team_id`.** COMM-308's second acceptance criterion asserts it did. It
    does not: the policy has no column restriction, so a member could switch
    teams at will, including onto the winning team on the last day. A new
    `challenge_participants_guard_team` trigger makes the premise true - a
    member may set `team_id` once, from null (which is exactly what the
    shipped COMM-204 client does), and every later move is the coach's.
  - **`captain_id` is pinned to `chal_set_captain`**, not merely permission
    gated. `challenge_teams_update_perm` already grants a holder a whole-row
    UPDATE, so without the pin the audit row would be optional in practice.
    Same transaction-local GUC hatch `protect_is_admin` uses.
  - **"Team not empty" is a BEFORE DELETE trigger**, the ticket's
    server-enforced option rather than its client-blocked one - with a
    cascade escape hatch, without which deleting a whole team challenge
    would have become impossible.
  - **No `action_type` was added**, only two `target_type` values. Both
    functions are a challenge edit by a challenge manager, which
    `'challenge_edit'` already means.

### Needs from schema, recaps (Phase 3)

- ~~`monthly_club_recaps(id uuid pk, club_id uuid not null default
  default_club_id(), month_start date not null unique check
  (extract(day from month_start) = 1), sessions_logged integer not null
  default 0, posts_created integer not null default 0, new_members integer
  not null default 0, challenges_completed integer not null default 0,
  events_held integer not null default 0, generated_at timestamptz not null
  default now(), published_at timestamptz)`. Staff select-any; plain member
  select only `published_at is not null`; no client write grant.
  `recap_monthly_publish(p_id uuid)`, `security definer`,
  `community.analytics.view`/`is_admin` gated, stamps `published_at`, fans
  out the notification, writes `admin_actions`. COMM-309.~~ — **SHIPPED in
  202609010002, COMM-309.** No longer a forward reference: the built
  contract is **"## Needs from schema, monthly club recap (COMM-309, Phase
  3)"** above. Read that, not this. The table, both policies, the total
  absence of a client write path and `recap_monthly_publish`'s exact
  signature and gate all shipped as promised, with four things this line did
  not name:
  - **Generation shipped as `recap_monthly_generate(p_month_start date
    default null) returns uuid`, a service-role-only Postgres function, not
    an Edge Function.** The `recap_monthly_club` stub under "Edge Functions"
    is struck through accordingly. Four reasons, recorded above.
  - **`monthly_club_recaps_freeze()`**, a BEFORE UPDATE trigger that raises
    on any update of a published row. Without it, "cannot be un-published"
    would be a property of the generator's SQL, and the service role
    bypasses RLS.
  - **`admin_actions.target_type` gained `'monthly_club_recap'`** as well as
    the `action_type` label — the first widening of the target list since
    202608280002.
  - **The read boundary is wider than the publish boundary.** A coach can
    preview a draft (`is_staff()`) but cannot publish
    (`community.analytics.view` or `is_admin()`). The client half must gate
    the publish control on the permission, not on staffness.
- ~~`weekly_recaps` gains `classmates jsonb not null default '[]'`, written
  only by `recap_weekly` (service role). `onboarding_progress` gains
  `first_class_shown_at timestamptz` and `third_class_shown_at
  timestamptz`, both covered by the existing `onboarding_progress_pin`
  trigger. COMM-316, closing COMM-P06 and COMM-P07.~~ — **SHIPPED in
  202609010003, COMM-316.** All four columns landed exactly as named. Two
  things this line did not name, both recorded in full above:
  - **`recap_weekly_classmates(p_user uuid, p_week_start date default null,
    p_limit int default 5) returns jsonb`**, service-role only. The line
    needed a data source and this outline had none; see its own entry under
    "### recap_weekly_classmates" for the signature and, more importantly,
    for why it cannot call `can_view_profile_field()`.
  - **The existing `onboarding_progress_pin` trigger did NOT already cover
    the two new columns** and had to be extended.
    `onboarding_progress_pin_shown()` names its columns one at a time, so
    both new stamps would have been freely clearable and freely re-movable
    by their owner — the one-way rule holding for three columns out of
    five, which every test that only exercised the old three would have
    passed. 0047 asserts the behaviour as a sweep over every `timestamptz`
    column so a sixth step cannot repeat it.

### Needs from schema, admin-moderation (Phase 3)

- ~~`analytics_dashboard(p_period_start date, p_period_end date) returns
  jsonb`~~ — **SHIPPED in 202609010006, COMM-310.** No longer a forward
  reference: the built contract is **"## Needs from schema, admin analytics
  dashboard (COMM-310, Phase 3)"** above. Read that, not this. It shipped as
  promised — same signature, `security definer`,
  `community.analytics.view`/`is_admin` gated, one call for all 18 metrics —
  with five additions a dependent ticket must know about:
  `analytics_wcam_events()`, **the single server-side WCAM definition, which
  COMM-311, COMM-312 and COMM-313 must call rather than repeat**, plus four
  internal helpers granted to no role. `p_period_end` is INCLUSIVE and the
  span is capped at 366 days. Four places where `metrics.md` under-specifies
  were resolved by judgment and are written out in that section; read them
  before reusing a number from it.
- ~~`member_segments(p_as_of date default current_date) returns setof jsonb`
  — `security definer`, same gate. COMM-311. Open question: segment set and
  thresholds not spec-grounded, see the ticket file.~~ — **SHIPPED in
  202609010007, COMM-311.** No longer a forward reference: the built contract
  is **"## Needs from schema, member engagement segmentation (COMM-311, Phase
  3)"** above. Read that, not this. It shipped as promised — same signature,
  `security definer`, `community.analytics.view`/`is_admin` gated, WCAM taken
  from `analytics_wcam_events()` with no second copy of the list. The open
  question was resolved by the user on 2026-08-31 ("build against the ticket's
  proposed shape as-is"), and building it surfaced **two gaps the ticket's
  proposed shape did not cover, both closed by judgment and both written out
  in that section**: the five named buckets are **not exhaustive** (a sixth,
  `occasional`, was added for members active in 1–3 of the last 8 weeks), and
  the ticket states **no precedence** between overlapping buckets (resolved as
  `new` > `declining` > `highly_active` > `steady` > `occasional` >
  `dormant`, with `declining` deliberately above `highly_active`). Also note
  the drill-down's `visible_to_club` handling: a hidden member is **counted
  but not named**, and the raw column is read rather than
  `can_view_profile_field()`, which would be a no-op for this function's
  admin callers.
- ~~`community_health_scores(...)` table plus
  `community_health_history(p_weeks int default 12) returns setof jsonb` —
  real `is_admin` only, narrower than the other three tickets in this
  cluster. COMM-312. Open question: weighting formula not spec-grounded.~~ —
  **SHIPPED in 202609010009, COMM-312.** No longer a forward reference: the
  built contract is **"## Needs from schema, community health score (COMM-312,
  Phase 3)"** above. Read that, not this. The table and
  `community_health_history()` shipped exactly as named, with the `is_admin`-
  only gate. **It shipped AFTER COMM-313**, which is the ordering correction
  recorded in that ticket's section and in `backlog.md`. The open question was
  resolved by the user on 2026-08-31 ("build against the ticket's proposed
  shape as-is"), and building it needed six decisions the shape does not make,
  all written out in that section:
  - **The weights are 0.40 / 0.25 / 0.25 / 0.10** (WCAM share, engagement per
    post, retention, moderation load), plus **two normalisation constants**
    the ticket does not mention at all — 3.0 interactions per post for full
    engagement marks, and 10.0 reports per 100 members per week for a zero on
    moderation. All six are a **starting split, expected to move**, and they
    travel inside every stored row so a trend line spanning a change is
    readable.
  - **The retention signal is the pooled week-4 retained share from
    `retention_member_weeks(6)`**, COMM-313's *private* helper — the only one
    of that migration's functions a service-role job can call, because the
    other three raise on a null `auth.uid()`. **That component is measured as
    of the run, not as of the scored week**, which is the sharpest limitation
    in the file; the fix is an as-of parameter on `retention_member_weeks()`
    itself and is an open item against COMM-313.
  - **Nothing calls `analytics_dashboard()`.** Not a performance choice: it
    raises on a null `auth.uid()`, so a scheduler cannot reach it. WCAM share
    and engagement per post are recomputed from the same sources, with
    `analytics_wcam_events()` as the only WCAM definition.
  - **A component with no data drops out and the remaining weights are
    renormalised**, rather than being scored zero. `weight_applied` records
    which ones did.
  - **The scheduled writer shipped as
    `community_health_generate(p_week_start date default null) returns uuid`,
    service-role only**, which the outline implies ("only a scheduled
    service-role job writes it") but does not name. It is **idempotent per
    week** via `on conflict (week_start) do update`, and it **refuses a week
    that has not finished**.
  - **Two CHECKs the outline does not name**: the `isodow` Monday constraint
    that makes `week_start unique` mean "per week" rather than "per date", and
    the 0..100 range on `score`.
- ~~`retention_cohorts(p_cohort_months int default 6)`,
  `retention_onboarding_correlation()`, `retention_welcome_correlation()` —
  real `is_admin` only. COMM-313. Open question: cohort window and which
  correlations, not spec-grounded.~~ — **SHIPPED in 202609010008, COMM-313.**
  No longer a forward reference: the built contract is **"## Needs from
  schema, retention correlation views (COMM-313, Phase 3)"** above. Read that,
  not this. All three shipped with the promised signatures and the `is_admin`-
  only gate. **It shipped BEFORE COMM-312 although its own ticket lists that
  as a dependency** — the dependency is real only in the other direction; see
  that section. The open question was resolved by the user on 2026-08-31
  ("build against the ticket's proposed shape as-is"), and building it needed
  four decisions the shape does not make, all written out in that section: the
  12-week curve runs on **membership weeks, not ISO weeks**; the minimum
  cohort size is **5** (the ticket's own example) and is applied to
  **individual `(group, week)` cells as well as to whole cohorts**; a week
  counts only once it has **fully elapsed**; and **soft-deleted members stay
  in their cohort**, which is a deliberate departure from COMM-310's
  denominator. Depended on COMM-316's two new `onboarding_progress` columns —
  both are cut on, alongside COMM-222's three. **The note below was written
  before the build and it held**: those columns record when a step was *shown*,
  not when the member's first or third class happened. The class dates
  themselves are `attendance_log.occurred_on`, and a member who has not opened
  the app since their third class has a null stamp and three attendance days
  at the same time — so a correlation keyed on the stamp is measuring
  onboarding reach, not attendance. That is why the returned boolean is called
  `stamped` and not `saw` or `completed`, and it is one of the reasons the
  ticket's "correlation, not causation" rule is not merely a copy concern.

### Needs from schema, identity-privacy (Phase 3) — SHIPPED

COMM-314 shipped in `202609010004` plus
`supabase/functions/purge_abandoned_profiles/index.ts`. The built contract,
with the one mechanism change from what was promised here, is **"###
purge_abandoned_profiles — SHIPPED"** above. Read that, not this. The
retention-window open question is resolved: 30 days, confirmed 2026-08-31.

## Needs from schema, registration and invite management (Phase 4)

**Built and verified 2026-09-03** (migrations 202609030001 through
202609030007, pgTAP 0056 through 0062). This section was rewritten after
the build to describe what shipped, per this file's standing rule that it
reflects final reality rather than the original proposal. Where the shipped
shape differs from what was specified before the build, the deviation and
its reason are marked **DEVIATION** inline — there are five, and four of
them share one root cause, described immediately below.

### Why four signatures changed: the invite schema was already hardened

The proposals in this section were written against `public.invite_codes`
**as it looked in 202608270003** — a plaintext `code text primary key` with
a `^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{4,32}$` CHECK. That column has not existed since
Phase 0. `202608270006_security_hardening.sql` ("Replace plaintext invite
codes with opaque IDs and hashes. Existing codes are revoked.") dropped it,
replaced it with `code_hash`, and re-keyed the table on a uuid `id`.

The live table is:

```
invite_codes(id uuid pk, code_hash text not null unique, role text,
             active boolean, created_at, expires_at,
             max_uses int check (max_uses between 1 and 1000),
             use_count int, revoked_at)
```

and `redeem_invite_code` (202608280013) **refuses any code not matching
`^[a-f0-9]{40,128}$` before it looks in any table**, with the standing note
that "the real protection remains the high-entropy codes from
202608270006."

Three consequences drove every deviation below:

1. **A short or 8-character code cannot be redeemed at all today.** It
   would be minted, handed to a real person, and always answer `invalid`.
   Widening that format gate to admit short codes re-opens the online
   guessing surface 202608270006 closed, for the whole redemption path.
2. **Hashing a short code buys nothing.** 36^8 unsalted sha256 candidates
   is minutes on one GPU, so the real choice was never "plaintext versus
   hash" but "short-and-plaintext-equivalent versus long-and-opaque."
3. **`create_member_invite` (202608270006) already does the long-code
   thing** in this schema for this exact purpose: 24 random bytes hex
   encoded, hash stored, plaintext returned once. Both new code minters
   reuse that generator byte-for-byte, which is what let COMM-372 widen
   redemption **without touching the format gate at all** and COMM-380 ship
   with no change to the signup field.

The practical cost, stated plainly: **a raw code is retrievable exactly
once, from the create call, and never again.** Neither list function
returns a `code` key. An admin who loses a code before sending it revokes
and mints a new one. For per-person invites `label` is what tells two
pending rows apart; for shared codes it is `id` and `created_at`.

### invites (table, COMM-370) — shipped

```
id uuid pk default gen_random_uuid()
club_id uuid not null default default_club_id() references clubs(id)
code_hash text not null unique check (code_hash ~ '^[a-f0-9]{64}$')
role text not null default 'member' check (role in ('member','coach'))
label text check (char_length(label) <= 120)
created_by uuid not null references auth.users(id)
created_at timestamptz not null default now()
expires_at timestamptz            -- null means never expires
revoked_at timestamptz
revoked_by uuid references auth.users(id)
redeemed_at timestamptz
redeemed_by uuid references auth.users(id)
constraint invites_not_both_revoked_and_redeemed
  check (revoked_at is null or redeemed_at is null)
```

- **DEVIATION:** `code_hash`, not the proposed plaintext `code text not
  null unique check (code ~ '^[A-Z0-9]{8}$')`. See above. There is no
  `code` column at all; pgTAP 0056 asserts that.
- RLS enabled, **zero policies and zero grants** for `authenticated` and
  `anon` — the same shape `invite_codes` and `invite_attempts` hold. The
  three functions below are the whole API. (RLS on with no policy is
  deny-all, which is why this satisfies the "no table reachable without a
  policy" rule rather than violating it.)
- `role` is an inline CHECK rather than the FK to `roles(code)` that
  `invite_redemptions.role` carries: only member and coach are invitable.
  Both values are valid `roles(code)` rows, so that FK still holds when a
  redemption is written.
- Indexes: `invites_created_at_idx (created_at desc)` for the list;
  `invites_pending_idx (code_hash) where revoked_at is null and redeemed_at
  is null` for the redemption probe.

### invite_status(p_revoked_at, p_redeemed_at, p_expires_at, p_now) returns text — NEW, not in the proposal

- Immutable, granted to `authenticated`. The single definition of an
  invite's lifecycle: `redeemed` > `revoked` > `expired` > `pending`.
- Read by `admin_invite_list` (both its `p_status` filter **and** its
  returned `status` key) and by `registration_funnel`'s `pending_now` /
  `expired_unredeemed_now`, so none of them can disagree. Same
  "one callable definition" shape as `attendance_session_record_types()`
  and `analytics_wcam_events()`.
- Takes `p_now` as a parameter precisely because it is immutable — it must
  not call `now()` itself.

### admin_invite_create(p_role text, p_label text default null, p_expires_at timestamptz default null) returns jsonb (COMM-370)

- **DEVIATION:** returns `jsonb`, not `public.invites`. A row type cannot
  carry the plaintext code, and the one-time reveal of that code is the
  entire point of the return value.
- Auth: `security definer`. `auth.uid()` checked first, then
  `has_perm('community.member.invite') or is_admin()`, and then — **NARROWED
  in `202609030008`** — a second gate that applies only when
  `p_role = 'coach'`: the caller must satisfy `is_admin()` specifically.
  - `p_role = 'member'`: unchanged, coach-and-above via
    `community.member.invite`. Inviting a new gym member stays a normal coach
    task.
  - `p_role = 'coach'`: admin/owner only. `community.member.invite` alone is
    no longer sufficient, so `coach`, `head_coach` and `staff` — all of whom
    hold that permission and none of whom is `is_admin()` (`role_rank >= 50`)
    — are refused. This puts minting a coach invite on the same tier as
    `admin_grant_coach`, previously the only admin-gated route to the coach
    role.
  - The refusal raises the same `'not authorized'` string as the other two
    auth failures, on purpose: a distinct message would tell the caller which
    tier they are missing. A client cannot distinguish them, so **COMM-376
    should offer the coach option only when the viewer is `is_admin()`** —
    and if it offers it anyway, the server still refuses.
  - Ordering: the coach-role gate runs *after* `'invalid role'` and *before*
    the label and expiry checks. A plain member is still refused before any
    role is inspected; a coach passing `'owner'` still gets `'invalid role'`.
- Errors, all `P0001`: `'not authorized'` (no session, no base permission, or
  the coach-role narrowing — one string for all three), `'invalid role'`
  (anything but member/coach, including null), `'label too long'` (over 120),
  `'expiry must be in the future'` (a non-null past value only; null is
  accepted and means never expires), `'could not generate a unique invite
  code'` (after 5 collisions, unreachable at 192 bits).
- Returns `{id, code, role, label, created_at, expires_at, status}`. **`code`
  appears here and nowhere else, ever.**
- Side effects: one `invites` row, `created_by = auth.uid()`. One
  `admin_actions` row: `invite_created` / `invite` / `target_id` = the new
  invite / `after_data {role, label, expires_at}`.

### admin_invite_list(p_status text default 'all', p_cursor timestamptz default null, p_limit int default 25) returns setof jsonb (COMM-370)

- Auth: the same base pair (`has_perm('community.member.invite') or
  is_admin()`). The `202609030008` coach-role narrowing does **not** apply
  here — it is keyed on `admin_invite_create`'s `p_role` argument, and this
  function has none. A coach lists and revokes coach-role invites they may
  not mint. Errors: `'not authorized'`, `'invalid status'`.
- `p_status` one of `all`, `pending`, `redeemed`, `revoked`, `expired`,
  resolved through `invite_status()`.
- `p_limit` clamped 1..100. Cursor-paginated on `created_at desc`,
  exclusive.
- Each row: `{id, role, label, created_at, expires_at, revoked_at,
  redeemed_at, redeemed_by, redeemed_by_display_name, redeemed_by_handle,
  status}`.
- **DEVIATION:** no `code` key. Only the hash is stored.
- The redeemer join is a LEFT join: a member can redeem and not yet have a
  profile (`profiles_insert_self` requires the redemption first, so every
  member passes through that window). Such an invite still lists, with both
  name keys null.

### admin_invite_revoke(p_invite_id uuid) returns void (COMM-370)

- Auth: same pair. Errors: `'not authorized'`, `'invite not found'` (also
  for null), `'already redeemed'`.
- Revoking a redeemed invite is refused outright and can never un-redeem
  anyone — enforced by the table CHECK as well as the function, so even a
  service-role hand edit cannot do it.
- Revoking an already-revoked invite is an idempotent no-op and writes **no
  second audit row**.
- Side effects: `revoked_at = now()`, `revoked_by = auth.uid()`; one
  `admin_actions` row `invite_revoked` / `invite`.

### admin_invite_code_create(p_role text default 'member', p_expires_at timestamptz default null, p_max_uses integer default 100) returns jsonb (COMM-371)

- **DEVIATION:** signature is `(p_role, p_expires_at, p_max_uses)`, not the
  proposed `(p_code text, p_role text)`, and it returns `jsonb` rather than
  `public.invite_codes`. There is no plaintext column to accept a
  hand-picked code into, and a short code could never be redeemed. Codes
  are server-generated with the same generator as everything else here.
- Auth: `security definer`, `auth.uid()` first, then
  `has_perm('community.invite.manage_codes') or is_admin()` — narrower than
  `community.member.invite` on purpose.
- Errors, all `P0001`: `'not authorized'`, `'invalid role'`, **`'shared
  codes cannot grant coach'`**, `'max uses must be between 1 and 1000'`,
  `'expiry must be in the future'`.
- **The coach refusal is a DEVIATION worth reading.** `redeem_invite_code`'s
  shared branch filters `role = 'member'` and inserts the literal
  `'member'` (202608270006: "Ordinary redemption never grants or upgrades
  to coach"), and COMM-372 leaves that branch untouched. A shared code with
  `role = 'coach'` would therefore be permanently unredeemable, so it is
  refused at creation rather than stored as a dead row. Coach access has
  two live paths: `admin_grant_coach` on an existing member, and a
  per-person coach invite, whose branch **does** grant the row's role.
- `p_max_uses` defaults to 100 (a shared code is meant to be reused),
  range 1..1000, the table's own CHECK re-asserted for a clean error.
  `p_expires_at` defaults to null, meaning the code stands until someone
  deactivates it.
- Returns `{id, code, role, active, created_at, expires_at, max_uses,
  use_count}`.
- Side effects: one `invite_codes` row, `active = true`. One
  `admin_actions` row `shared_code_created` / `invite_code` / **`target_id`
  = the row's uuid**. (The original note that `target_id` must be null
  "since `invite_codes`' primary key is text, not uuid" described
  202608270003; the PK has been a uuid since 202608270006.)

### admin_invite_code_list() returns setof jsonb (COMM-371)

- Auth: same pair. Error: `'not authorized'`. Unpaginated — a club has a
  handful of shared codes, not a feed of them. Ordered `created_at desc`.
- Each row: `{id, role, active, created_at, expires_at, revoked_at,
  max_uses, use_count, redemption_count}`.
- **DEVIATION:** `id` and the hardened-schema columns in place of the
  proposed `code`. No plaintext exists to return.
- `redemption_count` is `count(*)` from `invite_redemptions` for that code
  and is **deliberately a different number from `use_count`**: the shared
  branch bumps `use_count` in one statement and inserts the redemption in
  the next, and an already-redeemed caller returns early without touching
  either. `use_count` is the rate-limit counter; `redemption_count` is the
  membership figure. pgTAP 0057 asserts they differ.

### admin_invite_code_set_active(p_code_id uuid, p_active boolean) returns void (COMM-371)

- **DEVIATION:** keyed on the uuid `id`, not `p_code text`.
  `admin_invite_code_list` returns that id for exactly this call.
- Auth: same pair. Errors: `'not authorized'`, `'active required'`,
  `'code not found'`.
- **No retroactive effect** (backlog Phase 4 open question 2):
  `invite_redemptions` rows are untouched either way; deactivating only
  stops future matches, since the shared branch already filters on
  `active`. Reversible.
- Setting the value it already has is an idempotent no-op and writes no
  audit row.
- Side effects: updates `active`; one `admin_actions` row
  `shared_code_status_changed` / `invite_code` / `target_id` = the uuid,
  `before_data`/`after_data` `{active}`.

### redeem_invite_code(p_code text, p_actor_key text default null) returns text — WIDENED (COMM-372)

- **Both overload signatures unchanged.** The one-argument wrapper was not
  redefined at all — it already delegates with a null actor key, so it
  picked the widening up for free. This is why COMM-380 is a copy review
  rather than a client change.
- **The `^[a-f0-9]{40,128}$` format gate is UNCHANGED and needed no
  widening**, because per-person codes are minted with the same
  24-random-byte hex generator. This was the one thing the proposal
  expected to have to change and did not.
- Branch order: `invite_codes` first, byte-for-byte as before, including
  the literal `'member'` grant. The per-person branch runs only when no
  active shared code matched.
- The per-person branch matches `code_hash = sha256(p_code) and revoked_at
  is null and redeemed_at is null and (expires_at is null or expires_at >
  now())`, and **grants the invite row's own role**, member or coach. It
  claims the row with a single `UPDATE ... RETURNING`, so two simultaneous
  redemptions of one code cannot both win — one matches zero rows and falls
  through to `'invalid'`.
- Side effects on a per-person match, all one transaction:
  `invites.redeemed_at = now()`, `invites.redeemed_by = auth.uid()`, and an
  `invite_redemptions` row with `person_invite_id` set and `invite_id`
  null.
- **Anti-enumeration, unchanged**: matched nothing, matched a spent invite,
  matched a revoked one, matched an expired one, or matched a deactivated
  or exhausted shared code — all return the identical generic `'invalid'`
  (backlog Phase 4 open question 3).
- Throttle is bumped **before both lookups**, so both code kinds cost the
  same to guess, and a valid code presented while throttled is still
  refused.

### invite_redemptions, new column (COMM-372)

- **DEVIATION, and a correction to the proposal.** The proposed
  "`invite_redemptions.invite_id uuid references public.invites(id)`,
  nullable, added by this migration" was not possible: that column already
  existed, was **NOT NULL**, and pointed at `invite_codes(id)`
  (202608270006).
- Shipped instead: `person_invite_id uuid references public.invites(id)`,
  nullable; `invite_id` **relaxed to nullable**; and
  `constraint invite_redemptions_one_invite_source check
  (num_nonnulls(invite_id, person_invite_id) = 1)`.
- Every pre-existing row satisfies it with no backfill. The partition is
  total and disjoint, which is what `registration_funnel` counts on.
- No RLS change: `invite_redemptions_self_select` is own-row and already
  covers the new column, and `member_roles()` returns only `user_id` and
  `role`.

### onboarding_step_content (table, COMM-373) — shipped as proposed

```
step text primary key check (step in
  ('welcome','first_week','first_month','first_class','third_class'))
title text not null check (char_length(title) <= 120)
body  text not null check (char_length(body) <= 2000)
updated_by uuid references auth.users(id)
updated_at timestamptz not null default now()
```

- Seeded with the five cards' current live Hebrew copy from `cloud.js`.
- **`first_week` and `first_month` are seeded with their fixed TITLE and an
  EMPTY body**, which is the byte-for-byte-correct seed rather than an
  omission: both of those cards' visible bodies are computed entirely at
  render time, so there is no fixed lead copy today and seeding one would
  change what a member sees. The `char_length` CHECK is an upper bound
  only; an empty body is legal on purpose, and gives staff somewhere to add
  a standing lead later — which is what the "appended after this table's
  `body`" split is for.
- RLS: `grant select, update to authenticated`. Read policy `using (true)`.
  Write policy `using (has_perm('community.content.manage_onboarding') or
  is_admin())` with the same WITH CHECK. **No insert or delete grant to any
  client role, admin included.**
- **A member's UPDATE does not raise** — a failing RLS `USING` clause on
  UPDATE makes the row invisible to the statement, matching zero rows. The
  copy is simply unchanged. Anything asserting a raise here is asserting
  something that never happens.
- `onboarding_step_content_pin_updated_by` (BEFORE UPDATE) pins
  `updated_by = auth.uid()`, `updated_at = now()`, **and `step =
  old.step`** — the third was not in the proposal and matters: `step` is
  the primary key and the client holds UPDATE on the whole row, so without
  it a staff member could rename a card and break the five-rows-always-exist
  rule through the one grant that is given.
- `onboarding_step_content_audit` (AFTER UPDATE) calls
  `log_admin_action('onboarding_content_updated', 'onboarding_step', null,
  {step,title,body}, {step,title,body})`, with two guards the proposal did
  not name: it **skips when `auth.uid()` is null** (log_admin_action raises
  on a null uid, so a service-role copy fix would otherwise fail outright)
  and **skips when neither title nor body changed** (the pin trigger
  rewrites `updated_at` on every update, so every idempotent save would
  otherwise log a change that did not happen).
- Step precedence is untouched; this ships copy editing only.

### intro_carousel_content (table, Redesign Phase 3) — shipped as proposed

```
step text primary key check (step in
  ('welcome_intro','club_rules','getting_started'))
title text not null check (char_length(title) <= 120)
body  text not null check (char_length(body) <= 2000)
updated_by uuid references auth.users(id)
updated_at timestamptz not null default now()
```

- **A new, sibling table, not a widening of `onboarding_step_content`.**
  That table is a closed five-row *recurring* lifecycle system (one card
  shown at different points over a member's first month, gated by
  attendance/elapsed time); this is a closed three-row *one-time* system
  (three screens shown back-to-back, once, before a profile even exists).
  Folding three more keys into the five-row table would break its own
  documented "exactly five, always" invariant for every existing reader,
  for no shared benefit — the two systems share no code path.
- `step` is not an FK to anything: the three names are a client-side
  constant (`INTRO_CAROUSEL_STEPS`, cloud.js) and the CHECK is the only
  place a fourth step name could be refused.
- Seeded with the mockup's own three screens, translated into the
  club-agnostic voice every other seeded string in this schema uses
  (`welcome_intro`, `club_rules`, `getting_started`).
- RLS, byte-identical shape to `onboarding_step_content`'s own, renamed:
  `grant select, update to authenticated`; read policy `using (true)`;
  write policy `using (has_perm('community.content.manage_onboarding') or
  is_admin())` with the same `WITH CHECK`. **No insert or delete grant to
  any client role, admin included** — the step set is exactly three and
  changing it is a migration, not an app action.
- `intro_carousel_content_pin` (BEFORE UPDATE) pins `step = old.step`,
  `updated_by = auth.uid()`, `updated_at = now()` — same shape and same
  reasoning as `onboarding_step_content_pin_updated_by`.
- `intro_carousel_content_audit` (AFTER UPDATE) reuses
  `onboarding_step_content`'s own audit label — `log_admin_action`
  with `action_type = 'onboarding_content_updated'`, `target_type =
  'onboarding_step'` — deliberately, not a new label: both tables are
  "staff edited onboarding copy" from an audit reader's point of view, and
  this admin_actions label was already in the closed list since
  `onboarding_step_content`'s own migration (202609030004).
- A member's UPDATE does not raise, for the same reason
  `onboarding_step_content`'s doesn't: a failing RLS `USING` clause on
  UPDATE matches zero rows rather than erroring.

### Nine client-reachable functions with no contract entry (launch-readiness audit gap-fill)

All nine shipped correctly and are already exercised by client code and/or
pgTAP; the gap was purely documentation — none of the nine had ever had its
signature, auth model or deviations written down here. Filled in as found,
with no behavior change.

**`club_feature_enabled(p_module_key text, p_sub_key text default null)
returns boolean`** — shipped 202609010012 (Club Modules). `stable security
definer`, granted to `authenticated`. The single predicate every
module-gated RLS policy and `isModuleEnabled()` (cloud.js) both call.
Returns `true` when no `club_features` row exists for the key — a module
this migration doesn't seed (or a future client-only-hidden one) is never
accidentally locked out by a missing row. `p_sub_key`, when given, ANDs the
module's own `enabled` with `coalesce((config ->> p_sub_key)::boolean,
true)` — an absent sub-key defaults open, same reasoning as the missing-row
case. Six seeded modules today: `announcements`, `events`, `challenges`,
`achievements`, `feed`, `leaderboards` — comments/reactions/workout-sharing,
directory and notifications are deliberately NOT gateable here (see the
migration's own header for why each was excluded). Writes go exclusively
through `admin_set_club_feature()`, not a direct table write.

**`request_account_deletion() returns void`** — shipped 202608260001.
`security definer`, granted to `authenticated`, no `auth.uid()`-null guard
needed since RLS/grants already require a session to call it. Upserts an
`account_deletion_requests` row (`purge_after = now() + 30 days`, resets on
a repeat call) and immediately soft-deletes the caller's own `profiles` row
and every `workout_posts` row they authored (`deleted_at = now()`) — the
account becomes invisible right away; the 30-day window is a recovery grace
period before `purge_due_accounts()` (below) actually removes the
`auth.users` row.

**`admin_remove_member(p_user_id uuid) returns void`** — shipped
202608270011. `security definer`, granted to `authenticated`; inline
`is_admin()` check (`raise 'not authorized'` otherwise), a real
`profiles.is_admin` row, not `is_staff()` — a coach cannot remove a member.
Refuses `'use account deletion for your own account'` when
`p_user_id = auth.uid()`, forcing an admin through their own
`request_account_deletion()` for themselves. Otherwise mirrors that
function's exact effect (same upsert, same immediate soft-delete of profile
and posts) triggered on someone else's behalf. **Since 202609060022 it also
writes exactly one `admin_actions` row** (`member_remove` / `member` /
`target_id` = the removed member, `after_data` `{posts_removed,
purge_after}`), logged after the writes so a failed removal leaves no audit
row claiming it happened. Before that migration the single most destructive
staff action in the module was completely untracked.

**`purge_due_accounts() returns integer`** — shipped 202608260001,
`service_role` only (`revoke ... from public, anon, authenticated`), no
`auth.uid()` check — there is no session to check, the documented exception
every scheduled-job function in this schema carries (same shape as
`notif_batch_flush_due()`, `coach_detect_engagement_decline()`,
`recap_weekly`). Hard-deletes every `auth.users` row whose
`account_deletion_requests.purge_after <= now()` (cascading through
`profiles`' own FK). Returns the number of rows actually removed. **No
scheduler invokes this today** — 202609050005 wired a real `pg_cron`
schedule for six of this module's other periodic functions (see "### The
schedule (202609050005)" below) but did not include this one; it remains
reachable only by running it by hand as `service_role`. A cron/Edge
Function wiring is a separate ticket, not a bug in this function.

**`can_upload_post_photo(p_name text) returns boolean`** — shipped
202608270006, the Storage `post-photos_insert_own` policy's `WITH CHECK`.
`stable security definer`, granted to `authenticated`. True only when: the
caller has a session, the object path's first segment is literally the
caller's own `auth.uid()` (so nobody can write into another member's
prefix), the caller is a live (`deleted_at is null`), invite-redeemed
member, and the caller already has fewer than 20 objects under their own
prefix in `post-photos` — a per-member photo-count cap enforced at the
Storage layer, not just a client-side limit.

**`can_write_own_avatar(p_name text) returns boolean`** — shipped
202609010010, the `avatar-photos` bucket's own INSERT/UPDATE `WITH CHECK`
(both are required, not just INSERT: the client uploads with
`upsert:true`, and Storage evaluates that as `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO
UPDATE`, so the UPDATE path needs the identical check). Same shape as
`can_upload_post_photo` (own-prefix ownership + live redeemed member) but
**no object-count cap** — an avatar is one-per-member by client convention
(always uploaded to `{auth.uid()}/avatar.{ext}`), unlike post photos which
legitimately accumulate many-per-member across many posts.

**`club_summary() returns jsonb`** — shipped 202608280019, re-covered by
the SECURITY DEFINER read gate (202609060009, see "The gate is in nine
places" above — this was one of the five). `stable security definer`,
`auth.uid()`-null refused. Answers the club-header card in one round trip:
`name` and an `image_url` read off `clubs.settings` (**`TODO COMM-115`,
written into the function itself: `clubs` has no real image column yet —
the mark falls back to a lettermark client-side when unset**), a real
`member_count` (definer, so it's every live profile, not "everyone this
viewer hasn't blocked" a client-side count through
`profiles_read_authenticated` would give), the single active
`challenges` row ending soonest, falling back to the current
`weekly_challenges` row when `challenges` (Phase 2) has none active — which
is the only path that actually renders today, since `challenges` starts
empty — and the caller's own unread notification count.

**Return shape, as shipped after 202609060027** (signature unchanged, the
addition is additive and an existing reader is unaffected):

```
{ name, image_url, member_count, unread_notifications,
  active_challenge: { id, title, source, starts_at, ends_at, comparison_key } | null }
```

`comparison_key` and `starts_at` were added by 202609060027 so the caller no
longer has to re-read `weekly_challenges` to find out whether the advertised
challenge is one a member can actually join. `comparison_key` is **null when
`source` is `'challenge'`** — `public.challenges` has no such column — and
that null means "this challenge kind needs no key", not "invalid"; branch on
`source`. The key it carries is shape-checked only
(`weekly_challenges_comparison_key_shape`, 202609060026); whether it names a
real movement or WOD is a client-catalog question and stays the client's.
See "Weekly-challenge key integrity" at the end of this document.

### admin_member_roster(p_cursor timestamptz default null, p_limit int default 25) (COMM-374)

- **DEVIATION:** `returns table(id uuid, handle text, display_name text,
  avatar_url text, is_admin boolean, role text, redeemed_at timestamptz,
  last_activity_on date)`, not the proposed `setof jsonb`. The ticket's own
  migration outline specifies the table form, and it makes the
  identical-shape claim checkable by the type system — pgTAP 0060 asserts
  `pg_get_function_result` is byte-identical to `admin_search_members`'.
- Auth: `security definer`, `stable`; `auth.uid()` first, then `is_staff()`
  — a coach may browse read-only. Error: `'not authorized'`.
- Role changes stay on `admin_grant_coach`/`admin_revoke_coach` with their
  own inline `is_admin()`; a coach sees every row and can act on none.
- Cursor-paginated on `coalesce(invite_redemptions.redeemed_at,
  profiles.created_at) desc`, **with `profiles.id` as a tie-break** — the
  coalesced date is not unique (an imported club shares one timestamp
  across many rows) and a cursor paginator whose sort key repeats can loop
  or skip. `p_limit` clamped 1..100.
- Excludes soft-deleted profiles. A profile with no `invite_redemptions`
  row still appears with `role` and `redeemed_at` null, sorting on its
  `created_at` fallback.

### registration_funnel(p_period_start date, p_period_end date) returns jsonb (COMM-375) — shipped as proposed

- Auth: `security definer`, `stable`. `auth.uid()` first, then
  `has_perm('community.analytics.view') or is_admin()` — the same pair and
  order as `analytics_dashboard`, **not** `is_staff()`, so a coach is
  refused here while being allowed by `admin_member_roster`.
- Period rules identical to `analytics_dashboard`: end inclusive, 366-day
  cap, both bounds required, validated never clamped. Errors:
  `'not authorized'`, `'period required'`, `'period end before start'`,
  `'period exceeds 366 days'`.
- Response shape exactly as proposed:

```
{ period: { start, end, end_exclusive, days },
  shared_codes: { active_count, redemptions_in_period },
  per_person_invites: { created_in_period, redeemed_in_period,
                         revoked_in_period, pending_now,
                         expired_unredeemed_now },
  funnel: { invites_issued, redeemed, profile_completed, verified,
            redeemed_rate, profile_completed_rate, verified_rate } }
```

- `pending_now` and `expired_unredeemed_now` go through `invite_status()`,
  the same function `admin_invite_list` filters on, so the dashboard count
  and the invite screen cannot disagree. Those two and `active_count` are
  **as of now**, not period-filtered, by intent.
- Shared-code redemptions are identified by `invite_id is not null`,
  per-person by `person_invite_id is not null` — total and disjoint by the
  new CHECK, so nothing is double counted or lost.
- `funnel.invites_issued` counts per-person invites only (open question 7).
  **`redeemed` can legitimately exceed `invites_issued`, and
  `redeemed_rate` can exceed 1**, in a club still mostly using the shared
  code. pgTAP 0061 asserts that shape holds rather than treating it as a
  bug; COMM-379 should render it, not clamp it.
- "Profile completed" = a `profiles` row with `created_at` in the period,
  **deleted_at deliberately not filtered**: a member who completed their
  profile in a period and later left still completed that step, and
  excluding them would silently rewrite a past period's funnel every time
  someone deletes their account. "Verified" = `recovery_verified_at` in the
  period.
- Ratios `null`, never `0`, over a zero denominator, via `analytics_ratio`.
- Aggregate only — 0061 asserts structurally that the whole serialised
  response contains no uuid, handle or display name anywhere.

### admin_actions widened labels (Phase 4) — shipped

`action_type` gained `invite_created`, `invite_revoked`,
`shared_code_created`, `shared_code_status_changed`,
`onboarding_content_updated`. `target_type` gained `invite`,
`invite_code`, `onboarding_step`. Drop-and-recreate with the full
cumulative list in each of 202609030001, 202609030002 and 202609030004,
the pattern 202609010001/002/005/012 used.

### New permissions (Phase 4) — shipped

- `community.member.invite` (COMM-370) — seeded `coach`, `head_coach`,
  `staff`, `admin`, `owner`. **Note:** the planning text described this as
  "the same tier `community.member.restrict` already uses"; that comparison
  is inaccurate — `community.member.restrict` is seeded to `head_coach`,
  `admin` and `owner` only, not to `coach`. The explicit role list was
  built, and it does include `coach`.
- `community.invite.manage_codes` (COMM-371) — seeded `admin`, `owner`.
- `community.content.manage_onboarding` (COMM-373) — seeded `coach`,
  `head_coach`, `staff`, `admin`, `owner`, matching
  `community.announcement.publish`.

### One privilege boundary flagged for confirmation

`invites.role` admits `coach`, and `community.member.invite` is held by
`coach`. So **a coach can mint an invite that makes a stranger a coach**,
and coach is a real elevated tier (`is_staff()` gates the roster,
attendance reads and the coach tools). That is what COMM-370's acceptance
criteria and open question 6's chosen default jointly specify, it is
audited on creation, and it is built as specified — but it is a genuine
escalation path and is flagged rather than quietly narrowed. Narrowing it
later is a one-line CHECK change plus a re-seed of the permission.

### admin_search_members(p_query text) — FIXED, not a Phase 4 ticket

Found while building COMM-374. This function raised `42702 column
reference "id" is ambiguous` for **every caller including a real admin**,
from 202608270011 until `202609030007_fix_admin_search_members_ambiguity.sql`.
Its `returns table(id uuid, ..., is_admin boolean, ...)` OUT parameters
shadowed `profiles.id`, `profiles.is_admin` and `profiles.deleted_at`
inside its own authorization guard, and PL/pgSQL's default
`variable_conflict = error` refuses rather than guessing — before the
permission check can pass or fail, which is why the failure looked like a
permission denial.

`admin_grant_coach` and `admin_revoke_coach` carry the byte-identical
guard and were always fine: they return void, so they have no OUT
parameters to collide with. That is why the defect survived a copy-paste
into three functions.

The fix aliases the table in the guard. **Signature, returned columns,
query, ordering, limit and grants are all unchanged**, so no client
reading these rows needs to change. Relevant to Phase 4 because COMM-377
is specified to reuse this exact surface. pgTAP 0062 leads with the
assertion that was missing for the whole life of the defect: an admin
calls it and really gets rows back.

## The scheduler, retention, and four widenings (202609050001–202609050005)

Five migrations, applied in order, plus pgTAP `0063_scheduler_reports_and_retention_test.sql`
and an amendment to `0006_feed_telemetry_test.sql`.

### admin_actions.action_type gains 'member_password_reset' (202609050001)

Twentieth label, added with the same `drop constraint if exists` /
`add constraint` widening 202609010001, 202609010002 and 202609030004 use.
`target_type` is untouched: `member` has been in that list since
202608280002 and is exactly right for a credential act on a member.

### admin_log_password_reset(p_user_id uuid) returns void (202609050001)

- Purpose: write the `member_password_reset` / `member` audit row for an
  admin-initiated password reset. **It does not reset anything.** GoTrue owns
  `auth.users.encrypted_password`, so the reset itself happens in
  `supabase/functions/admin_reset_password/` through
  `auth.admin.updateUserById()`; this function is the audit half.
- Params: `p_user_id`, the member whose password was reset. There is
  deliberately **no `p_admin_id`** — the actor is `auth.uid()` and can never
  be passed in, so an Edge Function cannot attribute a reset to someone who
  did not do it. That is also why the Edge Function must call this with the
  **acting admin's own JWT**, not the service-role key: a service-role call
  has no `auth.uid()` and is refused.
- Auth: security definer. A real `profiles.is_admin` row that is not
  soft-deleted — the narrow gate, not `is_staff()` and not `has_perm`, so a
  coach and a head_coach are both refused. Grant execute to `authenticated`;
  the `is_admin` check inside is the gate. This is deliberately wider than
  `log_admin_action()` itself, which stays granted to no client role.
- Raises: `not authorized` (no session, or not an admin),
  `target member required` (null target), `member not found` (no live profile).
- Side effects: exactly one `admin_actions` row via `log_admin_action()`.
  `before_data` is null and `after_data` is `{"method": "admin_temp_password"}`
  — no credential material, not even a hash, because `admin_actions` is
  readable by every `community.analytics.view` holder.

### reports.target_type gains 'profile' (202609050002)

`check (target_type in ('post', 'comment', 'profile'))`, widening the inline
CHECK 202608280024 declared. See the amended `report()`, `mod_queue()` and
`mod_review()` entries under **Moderation and admin** above for what each
one does with the new arm. `post_id` stays null for a profile target, the
same as for a comment.

### mod_alert_recipients(p_club_id uuid) returns setof uuid (202609050003)

- Purpose: every member of `p_club_id` who may act on the moderation queue.
  The per-ROW form of the per-SESSION gate `mod_queue()` and `mod_review()`
  use, needed because `has_perm()` answers about `auth.uid()` and a fan-out
  asks about someone else — the same problem `notif_on_achievement()` solved
  by computing the mutual-follow join directly instead of calling
  `are_friends()`.
- Definition: a non-deleted `profiles` row in that club that is either
  `is_admin`, or holds `community.comment.moderate` through its
  `invite_redemptions.role`, or has role `owner` (mirroring `has_perm()`'s
  owner short-circuit). It reads `role_permissions` rather than hardcoding a
  role list, so a re-seed of that permission changes this automatically.
- Auth: security definer to read `profiles`, `invite_redemptions` and
  `role_permissions` past their own RLS. **Granted to no role** — that missing
  grant is the boundary, the same one `notif_create()` relies on. No
  `auth.uid()` check, because it never acts on the caller's behalf.
- Ordered by `profiles.id`, so a fan-out is deterministic. Returns no rows for
  a null or unknown club.

### AFTER INSERT on public.reports — notif_on_report() (202609050003)

- Trigger `reports_notify_moderators`, `for each row`. Returns NULL.
- Notifies every `mod_alert_recipients()` member of the **reporter's** club
  (`profiles.club_id`, falling back to `default_club_id()`) with an immediate
  `new_report` notification in category `community`, one `notif_create()` call
  per recipient — the exact convention `notif_on_comment()`,
  `notif_on_mention()` and `notif_announcement_fanout()` already use.
- `notif_create()` is not bypassed, so all four of its filters apply: the
  reporter never gets their own alert; a moderator on either side of a block
  edge with the reporter is skipped; an `off` preference on `new_report`
  suppresses; and the 1-hour de-dupe collapses repeats.
- **`source_type`/`source_id` are the reported TARGET, not the report row.**
  That is what makes the de-dupe useful: five members reporting the same post
  inside the window produce one alert per moderator, matching the single
  `mod_queue` row those five reports fold into. Consequence, stated: a target
  re-reported inside the window does not alert again even if the first report
  was already dismissed.
- Deep links: `/community/feed?post=<id>`,
  `/community/feed?post=<post>&comment=<id>`,
  `/community/account?user=<id>`. All three satisfy
  `notifications_deep_link_check` and resolve through the existing
  `resolveNotifTarget()` in cloud.js with no client change.
- Does **not** fire on `report()`'s `on conflict do update` path — that fires
  UPDATE triggers, not INSERT ones.
- Writes nothing but `notifications`: no audit row, no status change.

### events.map_link must be null or http(s) (202609050004)

`check (map_link is null or (char_length(map_link) <= 500 and map_link ~*
'^https?://'))`, replacing the length-only inline CHECK from 202608280010.
The old constraint is found by definition (`ilike '%map_link%'`) rather than
by a guessed name, the way 202608280024 handled reports' inline reason CHECK.
One constraint does both jobs; the length rule is not dropped. Case-insensitive
and anchored, so `HTTPS://…` passes and `javascript:void(0)//https://x` does
not. Added validated, so a pre-existing non-http row would fail the migration
rather than be grandfathered in.

### retention_purge_telemetry(p_days integer default 90) returns integer (202609050005)

- Purpose: the first retention job in the module. Deletes `feed_impressions`
  rows with `shown_at` older than the window and `analytics_events` rows with
  `created_at` older than it. Returns the **total** rows removed across both
  tables — the "rows written" integer convention `notif_batch_flush_due()` and
  `recompute_feed_weights()` return.
- Params: `p_days` clamped to 1..3650; null is treated as 90.
- Auth: security definer, **granted to no role**, and no `auth.uid()` check —
  the documented exception every scheduled job in this schema carries, since a
  cron job has no session. The job runs as the function owner.
- Supporting indexes added in the same migration:
  `feed_impressions_shown_at_idx`, `analytics_events_created_at_idx`.
- Irreversible: no soft-delete, no archive. After the first run no surface can
  report on telemetry older than 90 days, including a backfill of a historical
  week. Stored answers (`community_health_scores`, `monthly_club_recaps`)
  survive; recomputing an old week does not.
- Scope: only these two tables. They are the module's only unbounded
  append-only telemetry; everything else has a natural ceiling or an existing
  purge.

### feed_impressions loses its direct INSERT grant (202609050005)

`revoke insert on public.feed_impressions from authenticated;` plus
`drop policy if exists feed_impressions_self_insert`. `feed_record_impressions()`
is now the only write path. The direct grant was never equivalent to the RPC:
the RPC caps a batch at 50, clamps `position`, forces `user_id = auth.uid()`
and de-dupes on `(user_id, feed_session_id, post_id)`, none of which a raw
PostgREST insert did. cloud.js's single impression call site is the RPC
(`cloud.js:2966`) and there is no `.from("feed_impressions")` anywhere in the
client, so nothing breaks. RLS stays enabled and `feed_impressions_self_select`
stays, so the table still has a policy and is still strictly own-row on read;
there was never an UPDATE grant or policy.

**`analytics_events` is deliberately left alone.** It has no RPC path at all —
`analyticsTrack()` in `src/analytics.js` does
`client.from("analytics_events").insert(row)` directly, by design, gated by
`analytics_events_insert_self` and the props-size trigger. Revoking that grant
would break every tracked event with nothing to fall back on. Only the purge
applies to it. pgTAP 0006 asserts both halves of this asymmetry.

### cron_invoke_edge_function(p_slug text) returns bigint (202609050005)

- Purpose: the bridge from `cron.schedule` (whose body is SQL) to an Edge
  Function (which is HTTP). POSTs `{}` to
  `<edge_functions_base_url>/<p_slug>` with an
  `Authorization: Bearer <service_role key>` header via `net.http_post`
  (pg_net), and returns pg_net's request id.
- **Neither the project ref nor the service-role key is in the migration.**
  Both are read at run time from Supabase Vault
  (`vault.decrypted_secrets`), under the names `edge_functions_base_url` and
  `edge_functions_service_role_key`. The migration creates those two secrets
  **with placeholder values**, only if a secret of that name does not already
  exist, so a re-run is safe and a project that already has real values is
  never overwritten.
- **Whoever runs this against the live hosted project must set both**, e.g.
  `select vault.update_secret((select id from vault.secrets where name =
  'edge_functions_base_url'), 'https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/functions/v1');`
  and the same for the key. Until then — which is the permanent state of every
  local `supabase start` and of CI — the function makes **no request**, raises
  a NOTICE, and returns null, so the two Edge Function jobs are scheduled and
  inert rather than firing POSTs at a hostname that does not exist.
- `p_slug` must match `^[a-z][a-z0-9_-]{2,63}$` or it raises
  `unknown edge function %`. No slash, no dot, no scheme, so the call cannot be
  redirected at another host or climb out of `/functions/v1/`.
- Asynchronous: pg_net queues the request, so this returns before the Edge
  Function has run and a failure surfaces in `net._http_response`, not here.
- Auth: security definer to read `vault.decrypted_secrets`, no `auth.uid()`
  check (scheduled-job exception), **granted to no role**.

### The schedule (202609050005)

`create extension if not exists pg_cron;` and
`create extension if not exists pg_net with schema extensions;` at the top.
Both ship in the Supabase Postgres image, pg_cron is already in
`shared_preload_libraries` with `cron.database_name = 'postgres'`, so
`supabase start` really does schedule these. `cron.schedule(name, …)` UPSERTs
on the job name, so the whole block is idempotent.

Before this migration there was **not one `cron.schedule` call anywhere in the
repo's history**, real or commented out. Six of these functions had shipped
and tested bodies that had never run on their own.

| job name | schedule (UTC) | body | cadence source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `notif-batch-flush` | `*/15 * * * *` | `notif_batch_flush_due()` | verbatim from 202608280028's dead comment |
| `recap_monthly` | `41 4 1 * *` | `recap_monthly_generate()` | verbatim from 202609010002's dead comment |
| `feed-weights-recompute` | `17 4 * * 1` | `recompute_feed_weights()` | verbatim from 202608310006's dead comment |
| `chal-notify-ending-soon` | `23 * * * *` | `chal_notify_ending_soon()` | **new decision**: hourly, so "ending soon" is never more than an hour late; the `ending_soon_notified_at` stamp makes extra runs free |
| `coach-engagement-decline` | `17 6 * * *` | `coach_detect_engagement_decline()` | **new decision**: daily; the signal is multi-week by construction |
| `purge-abandoned-profiles` | `31 3 * * *` | `cron_invoke_edge_function('purge_abandoned_profiles')` | **new decision**: daily hygiene; the 30-day retention window lives in the function's own `index.ts` |
| `recap-weekly` | `11 5 * * 1` | `cron_invoke_edge_function('recap_weekly')` | **new decision**: Monday, after the ISO week boundary and after the 04:17 weekly pass |
| `telemetry-retention-purge` | `47 3 * * *` | `retention_purge_telemetry()` | **new job**, daily so each pass deletes ~one day of rows |

Every job is on an odd minute rather than `:00`, the habit 202608310006
established, so eight jobs do not stampede the same instant. Verify with
`select jobname, schedule, active from cron.job;` and
`select * from cron.job_run_details order by start_time desc limit 20;`.

## Redesign, Phase 1: the "ניהול" (Manage) tab

A relocation, not a new feature. The admin/moderation/analytics/invites
surfaces that used to render one after another inside Community's "חשבון"
(Account) sub-tab now live on their own top-level bottom-bar tab
(`getNavItems()`, app.js), visible whenever `window.communityIsStaff()`
(cloud.js, mirrors `isStaff()`) is true - coach and above, the exact same
audience these sections already had, not the mockup's stricter admin-only
gate. `window.renderManageApp()` composes 7 sub-tabs (dashboard, members,
onboarding, moderation, settings, analytics, invites) tracked in
`state.ui.manageTab`, switched via `data-community-action="set-manage-tab"`.
Every render function moved is byte-identical to before; only its mount
point and lazy-load trigger changed. The lazy-load gates that used to read
`state.ui.tab === "account"` (inside `afterRenderCommunity()`) moved to a new
`window.afterRenderManage()` hook, gated on the matching `state.ui.manageTab`
value instead, called by app.js's `render()` when `tab === "manage"`.

One deliberate placement choice worth stating: `renderCommunityHealthScore()`
moved to the **dashboard** sub-tab (the mockup's own layout - the score is
the dashboard's headline card), not to analytics alongside
`renderAdminAnalyticsDashboard()`/`renderRetentionCorrelations()`.
`renderRegistrationFunnel()`, despite the plan's first draft, did **not**
move out of `renderAdminAnalyticsDashboard()` - it has no independent data
loader (`loadRegistrationFunnel()` only fires as a side effect of the
dashboard's own load completing) and no period selector of its own; moving
its render call without also giving it both would have shipped a funnel
that never loads for a staff member visiting Onboarding before Analytics.

## Redesign, Phase 2: club_features gains five more keys (202609050006)

No schema change beyond an `insert` - `club_features.module_key`
(202609010012) was declared as a shape check
(`~ '^[a-z][a-z0-9_]{2,31}$'`), not a closed enum, so there was nothing to
widen, and `admin_set_club_feature()` already upserts any key matching that
shape and already writes `club_feature_toggle` (already in
`admin_actions.action_type`'s closed list) for any module_key. The five new
keys: `directory`, `coach_tools`, `member_of_week`, `welcome_flow`,
`monthly_recap`. All seeded `enabled = true`.

**A real asymmetry from the original six, worth stating plainly**: none of
the five gates a table's RLS.
- `directory` has no RLS clause behind it on purpose, matching
  202609010012's own reasoning for never gating it in the first place
  ("profiles is the single most foundational read policy in the schema").
  Turning it off hides the Directory pill and its sub-tab; a member's
  profile stays exactly as readable through the feed, mentions, follows and
  every other existing surface as it always was.
- `coach_tools` (a master switch for the whole Coach sub-tab) and
  `member_of_week`/`welcome_flow`/`monthly_recap` (one each per Coach-tab
  section) gate a **staff-facing UI section**, not member data. The coach-
  only RPCs behind those sections (`coach_new_members`,
  `coach_inactive_members`, the member-of-week candidate/publish pair,
  `monthly_club_recaps`) keep their own independent `is_staff()`/`has_perm()`
  check regardless of this flag - turning a coach-tool flag off declutters a
  coach's own tab, it does not lock a door that was open.

Client side: `CLUB_MODULE_TOGGLES` (cloud.js) carries a `clientOnly: true`
marker on each of these so `renderClubModulesPanel()` never makes the
original six's blanket "enforced on the server" claim about a row where
that would be false - the Settings sub-tab now renders two labeled groups
("תכני קהילה" / "כלי מאמנים"), matching the mockup, with the caveat text
naming `directory` inline rather than only in a comment.

Two more real, user-visible behavior changes: the Community tab's own
`feed`/`directory` pills are now conditional pushes (`isModuleEnabled("feed")`
/ `isModuleEnabled("directory")`), removing the pill entirely when off -
before this, only the Coach pill worked that way, and feed/directory's
existing module flags gated content but never the pill itself. And the
Boards sub-tab gained the mockup's empty-state card
(`data-boards-all-off="1"`, "כל המודולים בלוח זה כבויים כרגע. הפעילו אותם
ב'ניהול › הגדרות'.") shown only when `challenges`/`events`/`leaderboards`
are all off - additive to, not a replacement for, the always-present legacy
`weekly_challenges` board, which predates and is independent of the
`club_features` module set and never itself goes blank.

pgTAP: `supabase/tests/0065_club_modules_coach_and_directory_test.sql`.
Client: new tests in `test/community-club-features.test.mjs` covering pill
removal, the coach master switch, the three independent coach-section
flags, and the Boards empty-state's exact trigger condition.

## Launch-readiness audit, Phases 1–2 (202609060001–202609060008)

Eight migrations, one per finding, each with the matching pgTAP file
(`0067`–`0074`). The `is_community_member()` read gate (finding 1) is
documented in **Identity and privacy** above; the two post RPCs (finding 8)
in **Posts**; the achievement copy fix (finding 9) in
`docs/community/achievement-seed.md`. What follows is the rest.

### community_streaks (view, re-declared in 202609060002)

- Same columns, same types, same order, still **not** `security_invoker` —
  it has to run with the owner's rights to aggregate past `activity_pings`'
  owner-only RLS, which is exactly why it re-applies every access rule by
  hand.
- It re-applied `deleted_at` and blocks and **nothing else**, so a member who
  switched `visible_to_club`, `in_leaderboards` and `show_attendance` all off
  was still fully readable through it — handle, display name, streak, and a
  raw `last_activity_on` date. Every sibling leaderboard surface
  (`feed_leaderboard`, `chal_progress`, `coach_celebrate_feed`,
  `member_of_week_candidate_set`) already got this right.
- Rules now: `deleted_at`, blocks in both directions, `is_community_member()`,
  and — for anyone but the caller — the subject's own `visible_to_club` AND
  `in_leaderboards`, tested **both** as raw columns and through
  `can_view_profile_field()`, so an admin's own rank cannot decide what the
  club is told (the doubled form `member_of_week_candidate_set` uses).
- **`show_attendance` gates the `last_activity_on` COLUMN, not the row**, and
  this is a considered deviation from a literal copy of the sibling pattern.
  That column is the only raw per-day date here, it is the one 202608270001
  routed through the admin-gated `coach_inactive_members()` instead of
  activity_pings' own RLS, and `show_attendance` defaults to **false** while
  the other two default to true. Gating the row on it would empty the view
  for the whole club — breaking the coach Welcome surface — for a toggle
  whose subject (the member's own logged training days, `attendance_log`;
  **not** class attendance, which this product has no source for at all —
  202609060024) this view's source (`activity_pings`, days the member opened
  the app) does not expose. Self and, through
  `can_view_profile_field`'s admin branch, an admin, are exempt.
- pgTAP: `supabase/tests/0068_community_streaks_privacy_test.sql`.

### avatar-photos bucket + avatar_photos_select_own_or_visible (202609060003)

- The bucket was created `public = true`. A public bucket is served by an
  endpoint that does not evaluate SELECT RLS at all, so an unauthenticated
  GET of `/storage/v1/object/public/avatar-photos/{uuid}/avatar.webp`
  returned the bytes — verified live — and the path is
  `{member uuid}/avatar.{ext}`, so a listing enumerates member UUIDs. It is
  private now, matching `post-photos`.
- `avatar_photos_select_all` was `for select` with no `to` clause, i.e.
  `to public`, anon included. Replaced by
  `avatar_photos_select_own_or_visible`, scoped `to authenticated`: own
  object always (a member must see the photo they just uploaded, including
  mid-onboarding), anyone else's behind `is_community_member()` AND
  `can_view_profile_field(owner, 'visible_to_club')` — the same resolution
  point `profiles_read_authenticated` uses, which settles blocks on the way.
  The owner is resolved from the object's own path prefix, compared as text
  so an arbitrary object name cannot raise on a uuid cast.
- The three write policies (`avatar_photos_insert_own`/`update_own`/
  `delete_own`, all keyed to `can_write_own_avatar`) are unchanged.
- **Client half, shipped with it.** `avatarHtml()` (cloud.js) resolves a
  short-lived signed URL through an `avatarUrlCache`, the same
  `photoUrlCache`/`resolvePhotoUrl` shape post-photos has always used, and
  renders the initials badge for the one paint before it lands (and
  permanently if signing is refused, which is a correct answer to "you may
  not see this face"). `profiles.avatar_url` still stores the
  `/object/public/` form: it is now an **identifier** for the object and the
  carrier for the `?t=` cache-bust, not a fetchable URL — it 400s if hit
  directly, which is the point. That keeps every stored row valid,
  `avatarPathFromUrl()` parsing, and the column satisfying its
  `^https?://` CHECK. The cache is keyed by the stored URL, not the path,
  because an avatar is overwritten in place and only the `?t=` stamp
  distinguishes two uploads.
- pgTAP: `supabase/tests/0069_avatar_bucket_private_test.sql` (the suite's
  first coverage of `storage.objects` RLS). Client:
  `test/community-avatar-upload.test.mjs`.

### workout_posts_guard_privileged_type() (BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE OF post_type on workout_posts, 202609060004)

- Raises `post type is staff only` (P0001) when a row would carry
  `POST_COACH`, `POST_ANNOUNCEMENT`, `POST_SYSTEM` or `POST_NEW_MEMBER` and
  its `author_id` is a member who is neither redeemed at
  `role_rank(...) >= 20` nor `profiles.is_admin`.
- Both vectors were live and both were verified: a plain member could
  `insert ... (author_id, post_type) values (me, 'POST_COACH')` **and**
  `update workout_posts set post_type = 'POST_COACH' where id = <own post>`.
  `posts_insert_self`/`posts_update_self` gate the author and say nothing
  about `post_type`; `default_post_type()` only fills the column when it
  arrives NULL. The label buys the "מאמן/ת" badge, 10 of `feed_page`'s 110
  ranking points, and membership of the `coach` feed scope.
- The predicate is byte-for-byte `feed_page`'s own `author_is_staff` branch,
  so the badge, the boost and the scope cannot disagree about who is staff.
- `author_id is null` is exempt, and that exemption is load-bearing: every
  legitimate producer of these four labels writes an authorless row
  (`post_new_member_on_join`, `member_of_week_publish`,
  `challenge_progress_apply`'s cooperative milestone,
  `attendance_milestones_on_log`).
- An UPDATE that leaves `post_type` unchanged returns early, so editing a
  real coach post is untouched. It has to be a trigger: an UPDATE policy's
  WITH CHECK sees only the new row and cannot tell "already was POST_COACH"
  from "is being promoted right now".
- **Not** scoped to `auth.role() = 'authenticated'`, unlike the 202609010005
  guards: this asserts a fact about the row's author, which is equally true
  for the service role and a dashboard edit.
- The two legitimate client writes — `congratulateCelebrateItem()` and
  `coachEngageReachOut()`, both `post_create` then one own-row update to
  `POST_COACH`, both on staff-gated surfaces — keep working unchanged.
- pgTAP: `supabase/tests/0070_post_type_privilege_guard_test.sql`.

### weekly_challenges policies (202609060005)

- `weekly_challenges_insert_admin` now checks
  `has_perm('community.challenge.create')` instead of `is_staff()`. `staff`
  ranks 40 (so `is_staff()` is true for it) and is **not** a seeded holder of
  `community.challenge.create`, which every other write in the Phase 2
  challenge model checks — so the two predicates genuinely disagreed for that
  role. Latent, not live: no shipped path grants `staff`.
- `announcements_insert_admin`'s `is_staff()` gate is deliberately **left
  alone**. It looked like the same bug and is not: every seeded role of rank
  >= 20 holds `community.announcement.publish`, so there is no member for
  whom the two disagree. 0071 asserts that, so the non-change is pinned
  rather than remembered.
- New: `weekly_challenges_update_perm` and `weekly_challenges_delete_perm`,
  both `has_perm('community.challenge.create')`, plus the UPDATE and DELETE
  grants. The table had carried a read policy and an insert policy and
  nothing else since 202608270001, so a typo in a challenge title was
  uncorrectable and unremovable by anyone, admin and owner included, short of
  a migration. Not scoped to `created_by`, matching `challenges_update_perm`.
- pgTAP: `supabase/tests/0071_challenge_write_boundaries_test.sql`.

### challenge_participants_guard_progress() (BEFORE UPDATE OF progress_value, status on challenge_participants, 202609060005)

- Raises `progress is server derived` (P0001) for **any** authenticated
  change to `progress_value`, staff included. There is no legitimate direct
  writer: the total is derived from the append-only `challenge_progress` log
  and a correction is a compensating negative delta through
  `chal_record_progress`, which is the mechanism 202608280009 already chose.
- Raises `status is server derived` for a status change other than (a) a
  `community.challenge.create` holder administering the challenge, or (b) the
  member's own row moving `active` -> `completed`, which is COMM-205's
  consistency self-completion and the one direct status write the shipped
  client makes (`logConsistencyWeekHit`).
- This closes the half of `challenge_participants_update_self`'s unrestricted
  self-row UPDATE that 202609010005 named and deliberately left open ("a
  member can still edit their own status and progress_value directly ... a
  separate, pre-existing question"). The inflation vector was live:
  `update challenge_participants set progress_value = 999999 where
  user_id = auth.uid()` was accepted.
- `completed_at` is deliberately not in the trigger's column list — it is
  meaningless without a status beside it, and including it would refuse the
  one legitimate write, which sets both in one statement.
- Both rules are bypassed inside the transaction-local
  **`app.allow_progress_apply`** pin, which only `challenge_progress_apply()`
  sets, around its own UPDATE. Same GUC-pin shape as
  `app.allow_captain_set` (202609010005) and for the same reason:
  `auth.role()` still reads `authenticated` inside a SECURITY DEFINER trigger.
  `challenge_progress_apply()` is re-declared in 202609060005, byte-identical
  except for the two `set_config` calls.
- Skipped entirely when `auth.role()` is not `authenticated`.
- pgTAP: `supabase/tests/0071_challenge_write_boundaries_test.sql`.

### profiles_avatar_url_check (202609060006)

- `avatar_url is null or (char_length(avatar_url) <= 500 and avatar_url ~*
  '^https?://')`. The column was plain `text` with no constraint at all,
  while `profiles_update_self` is unrestricted by column — so any member
  could store `javascript:...` in a value ~30 cloud.js call sites hand
  straight to an `<img src>` and that `admin_search_members()`,
  `member_roster()`, `people_suggestions()` and `community_search()`
  republish onto other members' screens.
- Exactly the rule `events.map_link` got in 202609050004, applied to the one
  remaining client-writable column rendered as a URL, and by a wider set of
  writers: `map_link` needs `community.event.manage`, this needs only
  membership.
- Drop-and-re-add by constraint-definition lookup, the mechanism
  202609050004/202609030004/202609050002 all use, so a live project that grew
  one by hand is corrected rather than left with two contradicting
  constraints. Added VALIDATED: a pre-existing bad row fails the migration
  loudly rather than being grandfathered in.
- pgTAP: `supabase/tests/0072_profiles_avatar_url_scheme_test.sql`.

### The SECURITY DEFINER read gate (202609060009)

Finding 1, part 2, and the reason `is_community_member()` now appears in nine
places rather than three.

- **What was still open after 202609060001.** Re-probing a ghost session
  against the already-fixed stack:

  | function | what a ghost got |
  | --- | --- |
  | `feed_page(null, 20, 'for_you')` | the whole club feed, every author attached |
  | `community_search('me', 10)` | members, posts and events, from two characters |
  | `community_profile(<uuid>)` | a complete member: tenure, follows, posts, achievements |
  | `club_summary()` | club name, image and `member_count` |
  | `member_roles(array[<uuid>])` | who is a coach |

- **Why the policies did not cover them.** All five are SECURITY DEFINER, so
  they read their base tables with the owner's rights and RLS never runs —
  that is the point of them (`feed_page` has to score across posts one at a
  time that the viewer may not be able to read one at a time). Every access
  rule therefore has to be re-stated inside the function, and each of these
  had re-stated exactly one: "somebody sent a token".
- **The gate is one line per function**, immediately after the existing
  `auth.uid()` check and nowhere else:
  `if not public.is_community_member() then raise exception 'recovery method required'; end if;`
  — same predicate, same message, same position every write path in the
  module already uses.
- **`community_profile` is the exception, with a self branch**, placed the
  same way `profiles_read_authenticated`'s is: reading your OWN profile is
  outside the gate. It sits *after* `v_target := coalesce(user_id, v_uid)`,
  because "is this me" cannot be asked before the coalesce (a null argument
  has always meant "my own profile"). It is not a hole — a ghost has no
  profile row, so asking for its own gets `profile not found` — and it is
  load-bearing: `0040` already asserts that a caller with their own
  `show_attendance` off still reads their own `current_streak` back.
- **`member_roles` returns an empty set rather than raising.** It is a
  best-effort badge cache (202609010011) that has always tolerated a missing
  row, so it must not start throwing at a client that never checked. The
  predicate is in its WHERE clause.
- **Why five functions and not seventy.** Every other client-callable definer
  read was probed in the same pass and already refuses, because it resolves
  `my_role_code()` — null for a caller with no profile row — rather than only
  asking whether a token arrived: `people_suggestions`, `feed_leaderboard`,
  `attendance_classmates_today`, `chal_progress`, and every `coach_*` and
  `admin_*` function. `my_permissions()` answers with nothing for the same
  reason. `0075` asserts that control set, so "five and not seventy" is a
  test rather than a claim.
- **The bodies were not retyped.** Each was read back out of the database
  with `pg_get_functiondef()` and re-emitted with the one line added, so
  nothing else can have drifted in transcription. Same
  full-recreation-with-one-added-gate shape 202609010012 used for
  `feed_leaderboard`, and the only mechanism Postgres offers — a function
  body cannot be patched in place. **The corollary matters for whoever edits
  `feed_page` next: 202609060009 is now the live definition of all four
  plpgsql functions, not 202608310006 / 202608290008 / 202608310004 /
  202609010012.**
- No client change. All five are reached only from surfaces that already
  require a stamped `recovery_verified_at`: `ensureCommunityDataLoaded()` is
  the sole caller of `loadFeed()`, `loadClubSummary()` and the role cache,
  and it returns early until the column is set.

## Five-persona UX audit (202609060019–202609060024)

Five migrations, one per defect. `pr_share` and `ach_share` (defect 1) are
documented under **Posts** and **Achievements** above; the audit-log identity
work (defect 2) is under **Moderation and admin**. What follows is the rest,
plus the two entries this file had never carried at all.

There is no `202609060021`. The number was not used; the sequence is 0019,
0020, 0022, 0023, 0024.

### The coach activity signals, rewritten (202609060020)

Neither `coach_inactive_members()` nor `coach_new_members()` had ever had a
contract entry here, which is part of why both were being read as training
signals in the client. Both are recorded now, in their post-rewrite shape.

**What was measured, once, against a seeded and visibly active club (41
posts, reactions, comments, several members posting):**
`coach_inactive_members()` returned 8 of 8 members as never-active, including
the coach who had posted moments earlier, and `coach_new_members()` returned
4 of 12 members who had all joined that same day.

**The source is `activity_pings`, and it is not a training signal.** That
table has exactly one writer in the whole system — `pingActivity()` in
`cloud.js`, which upserts TODAY only, from a live browser session, once the
profile has loaded. No trigger, no backfill, no server-side producer. It is
"one row per day the member OPENED THE APP" (202609060002). A member who
trains five mornings a week and dislikes phone apps has no pings at all.
Class attendance and check-in belong to Arbox, which this app reads from and
does not manage.

**Why these two were NOT repointed at `attendance_log`.** 202609060013
deliberately narrowed `attendance_log_staff_select` from
`has_perm('community.analytics.view') or is_staff()` down to the permission
alone, as an explicit product decision, because PRIVACY.md promises members
that coaches see a baseline rate and a recent rate and **not** a detailed
log. A real coach has `is_staff() = true`, `has_perm('community.analytics
.view') = false`, and reads zero attendance rows. Returning a per-member
last-trained date to a coach would reopen that hole to fix a UX bug. The
sanctioned attendance-based coach surface already exists and is already
honest: `coach_engagement_flags` fed by
`coach_detect_engagement_decline()` (202608310008), which compares a member
against their own baseline, refuses to flag anyone without an eight-week
baseline, and exposes rates rather than days.

#### coach_inactive_members(p_since date default (current_date - 7)) returns table(...)

- **DROP and CREATE, not `create or replace`** — the OUT parameter list
  changed and Postgres refuses to replace a function whose `returns
  table(...)` columns differ (42P13). Same name, same single date parameter,
  same staff gate, same source table.
- `returns table(user_id uuid, handle text, display_name text,
  last_activity_on date, state text, days_since_activity integer, joined_on
  date)`. **`state` is new and is the point of the rewrite**, a real
  enum-shaped contract the client branches on rather than something it infers
  from a null:
  - `'lapsed'` — we HAVE recorded app activity for this member and the most
    recent of it is older than `p_since`. A fact about a person; a coach may
    act on it.
  - `'no_data'` — we have recorded nothing for this member, ever. A fact
    about our data, not about the member. It must never be rendered as
    "never trained", and the client renders it in a separate, non-alarming
    group.
- The old shape merged the two with `max(activity_date) is null or
  max(activity_date) < p_since` in a HAVING clause and the client printed the
  literal string `מעולם לא` for the null branch. That is the whole of the
  8-of-8 result: an absence of data reported as a fact about a person.
- `days_since_activity` is **null** for a `no_data` member, deliberately —
  there is no "days since" a thing that never happened, and 0 or a huge
  number is something a client can accidentally render.
- **Members who joined on or after `p_since` are excluded.** They have not
  lapsed, they are new, and they belong in `coach_new_members()`, which is
  the list with the actions for them on it. Without the rule every new member
  appears in both lists from the day they join, and the alarming one is where
  a coach sees them first. The join date is the same
  `coalesce(invite_redemptions.redeemed_at, profiles.created_at)` the new-
  member list uses, so no member can fall into a gap between the two.
- Both states come back from one call rather than the client filtering, so
  "how many members are genuinely lapsed" has exactly one definition and the
  Manage tab's attention row cannot drift from the list it links to. That row
  previously counted the whole result set, which is why a club with no data
  reported every member as inactive on its landing screen.
- Order: genuinely lapsed first, longest-gone first within that; `no_data`
  members sort last — they are context, not a queue.
- Auth: `stable security definer`, inline `is_staff()`, raises `not
  authorized`. Granted to `authenticated`, revoked from `public`/`anon`.

#### coach_new_members(p_within_days integer default 14) returns table(...)

- DROP and CREATE, for the same 42P13 reason. Same name, same single integer
  parameter, same staff gate.
- `returns table(user_id uuid, handle text, display_name text, avatar_url
  text, joined_on date, days_since_join integer, sessions_logged integer,
  has_opened_app boolean, last_seen_on date, contacted boolean, contacted_at
  timestamptz, assigned_coach_id uuid)`.
- **`joined_on` is the join date**, `coalesce(invite_redemptions.redeemed_at,
  profiles.created_at)`, read across members because this is `security
  definer` — the same way `coach_celebrate_feed()`'s anniversary branch
  already reads `redeemed_at`. The old definition was
  `min(activity_pings.activity_date)` over an **INNER JOIN**, which
  (1) is a first-app-open date, not a join date, so for any member predating
  the feature it reported the feature's own deploy date, and (2) structurally
  excluded every member who registered and never opened the app again —
  exactly the member day-0 retention outreach exists for.
- `activity_pings` is now a **LEFT JOIN** and appears only as
  `has_opened_app` / `last_seen_on`. A member who registered and has not
  opened the app sorts to the top of the coach's attention.
- **`sessions_logged` is a COUNT, not a log, and the distinction is
  load-bearing.** It is `count(*)` over the member's `attendance_log` rows —
  read here rather than through a coach's own grant precisely because this
  function is `security definer` and can return the aggregate without handing
  the coach the rows behind it. It discloses no individual session, no date
  and no result, which is what lets a coach see it while 202609060013 keeps
  raw attendance rows at admin rank. It replaces the client's previous
  stand-in for this number, `community_streaks.current_streak`, which counts
  consecutive days the member OPENED THE APP and was being shown beside a new
  member's name where a coach would read it as training.
- `p_within_days` is **clamped** to 1..365 rather than rejected, the same
  shape `coach_celebrate_feed()` uses: this is a read a dashboard makes on
  load, and a bad number is a client bug, not an error toast in front of a
  coach.
- Order: newest first; within a single day, uncontacted before contacted, so
  the list reads as a work queue rather than a roster.
- Auth: `stable security definer`, inline `is_staff()`, raises `not
  authorized`. Granted to `authenticated`.

#### coach_activity_signal_status() returns table(...) — NEW

- `returns table(members_total integer, members_with_app_activity integer,
  members_with_logged_sessions integer, last_app_activity_on date,
  last_logged_session_on date)`. Always exactly one row.
- Purpose: the honest-empty-state input, and the reason it is a function
  rather than something the client infers. "The list came back empty" has two
  completely different meanings a client cannot tell apart from the list
  alone: "every member is active" (good news, and the old client said exactly
  that — `כולם פעילים`) or "we have never received a single ping from
  anybody, so this section knows nothing". A club that has just turned the
  community on gets the second and was shown the first. That needs a fact to
  fix, not a heuristic.
- `members_with_app_activity` counts members with any `activity_pings` row
  (days the app was opened); `members_with_logged_sessions` counts members
  with any `attendance_log` row (training logged in the app — never an Arbox
  class check-in, which this product does not see).
- Aggregate counts only, **no member identities**: this is a question about
  the dataset. Auth: `stable security definer`, inline `is_staff()`, raises
  `not authorized`. Granted to `authenticated`.

### admin_actions gains five identity columns (202609060022)

Defect 2. The audit log could not answer "who did what": a real moderation
decision's only durable record read `מנהל/ת f70f95f5 · לפני 3 דקות` — eight
characters of a uuid, a relative timestamp, and nothing else. No admin name,
no indication of who it was done to, which decision was taken, or why.

Five new columns, all nullable, no default, all filled by
`log_admin_action()` (above) rather than by ~40 call sites resolving identity
by hand:

| column | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `admin_display` | the acting admin's display identity AS IT WAS when the action was taken — display name, else `@handle`, else null. A snapshot, never a join. Max 160. |
| `target_user_id` | the MEMBER the action landed on, when there is one. No FK, for `admin_id`'s reason. |
| `target_display` | `target_user_id`'s label, same snapshot rule. Max 160. |
| `action_detail` | WHICH action was chosen inside the broader `action_type`. Free text, max 80. |
| `note` | the acting admin's own free-text justification. Max 1000. |

- **Why snapshots and not joins.** `admin_actions` has no FK to `profiles`,
  deliberately, so an audit row outlives the account that produced it — which
  also means a join resolves to nothing for exactly the admin most worth
  identifying. A decision must stay defensible under the name the person was
  actually using when they took it.
- **`action_detail` exists because `action_type` alone is not enough.**
  `comment_moderate` logs `content_delete` for BOTH `remove` and `restore`,
  so the log could not distinguish taking a comment down from putting it
  back. It now records `remove` / `restore`. Elsewhere: `mod_review`'s
  decision (`remove`, `warn`, `restrict_temp`, `restrict_permanent`,
  `dismiss`), the granted role for a `role_change`, `temporary` / `permanent`
  for a restriction, `lift` for a lifted one, `slot N` for a pin. Null where
  the `action_type` is already total.
- **`note` is the moderator note `mod_review`, `mod_restrict_member` and
  `mod_lift_restriction` already collected and then threw away** at the audit
  boundary.
- Index `admin_actions_target_user_idx (target_user_id, created_at desc)
  where target_user_id is not null`, for the `target_user_id` filter
  `admin_actions_page` gained.
- **The one-time backfill restates only what a row already carried**:
  identities resolved from `profiles` as they read at migration time (a late
  resolution of a real identity, not a snapshot — and null where the account
  was already gone); `target_user_id` from `target_id` for `member` targets;
  `action_detail` and `note` lifted out of `after_data` keys that already
  held them (`decision`, `role`, `restriction_type`, `reason`,
  `lift_reason`). A pre-existing row with no decision recorded keeps a null
  `action_detail` rather than acquiring a plausible one.
- **Two paths that wrote no audit row at all now do.**
  `admin_remove_member()` gains one `member_remove` row (see its own entry
  above). `review_report()` — the Phase 0 transition, superseded for the
  client by `mod_review()` but still granted to `authenticated` and still
  able to resolve a report — gains one `report_review` row, with the new
  status as `action_detail` and the resolution notes as `note`. Until
  202609060022 an admin could move a report through it and leave no trace.
- No signature changed except `log_admin_action`'s, so no `cloud.js` call
  site moved. `action_type` gained `member_remove` here and
  `invite_reclaimed` in 202609060023; that CHECK constraint is restated in
  full by whichever migration widens it last, this module's convention since
  202609010001.

### Ghost accounts holding invites (202609060023)

Defect 3. Signup is two-stage and the stages are separated by a three-slide
carousel: anonymous session → `redeem_invite_code()` → credentials →
CAROUSEL → the `profiles` insert → `mark_recovery_verified()`. The redemption
is what consumes the invite; everything after it is optional as far as the
database is concerned. Close the tab on slide two and what is left is a real
`auth.users` row, a real `invite_redemptions` row, a spent invite — and **no
`public.profiles` row at all**.

Every roster surface starts `from public.profiles`
(`admin_member_roster`, `admin_search_members`, `admin_user_directory`), so a
row that does not exist cannot be listed by any of them. `registration_funnel`
can see the shape of the problem — its redeemed vs profile_completed steps
are exactly this gap — but is aggregate-only by design and names nobody.
`purge_abandoned_profiles()` (202609010004) deliberately and correctly never
touches these accounts either: it requires **no** `invite_redemptions` row,
and a carousel ghost has one. The two paths are complementary, and
202609060023 is written to hand accounts TO that job rather than duplicate
it.

Two rejected alternatives, recorded because both look obvious: moving invite
consumption to profile creation (a redesign of the highest-risk function in
the module — `invite_redemptions` **is** the membership fact that
`is_community_member()`, `has_perm()`, `role_rank()` and `my_role_code()` all
read — to fix a reporting problem), and folding ghosts into
`admin_member_roster()` (which owes `admin_search_members` a byte-identical
eight-column shape so one client row renderer serves both).

#### admin_incomplete_signups(p_cursor timestamptz default null, p_limit integer default 25) returns table(...)

- `returns table(user_id uuid, username text, label text, role text,
  invite_source text, redeemed_at timestamptz, signed_up_at timestamptz,
  last_sign_in_at timestamptz, stalled_days integer,
  purgeable_after_reclaim boolean)`.
- Purpose: the accounts every roster surface is structurally blind to — an
  `auth.users` row that HAS redeemed an invite and has no `profiles` row.
- Auth: `stable security definer` (`auth.users` is not client-reachable at
  all); `auth.uid()` first, then **`is_staff()`** — the same read-only browse
  rank `admin_member_roster()` takes, because a coach chasing a member who
  never appeared is the obvious first user. Raises `not authorized`. Granted
  to `authenticated`.
- **`username` is a privacy boundary, not a convenience.** It is the LOCAL
  PART of `auth.users.email` and **only** when the address is this app's own
  synthetic `<username>@members.haimuniya.invalid` form (`usernameToEmail()`,
  cloud.js). Any other address — a real one, from any future provider —
  returns null rather than being handed to staff, because a login address a
  member gave for authentication is not roster data. The synthetic local part
  is the username the member typed into this app's signup form.
- `label` is the per-person invite's own admin-authored label ("דנה מהבוקר של
  שני"), usually the only thing that identifies a ghost who abandoned before
  setting credentials.
- `invite_source` is `shared_code` or `person_invite`.
  `purgeable_after_reclaim` is `auth.users.is_anonymous` — whether
  `purge_abandoned_profiles()` would collect this account once
  `admin_reclaim_invite()` removes the redemption row that currently
  disqualifies it.
- **A soft-deleted profile is NOT a ghost.** That row exists,
  `admin_member_roster` already owns it, and this function must not
  double-report a removed member as an unfinished signup. The predicate is
  "no `profiles` row at all".
- `p_limit` clamped 1..100; cursor pages backwards on `redeemed_at` with
  `user_id` as tie-break, `admin_member_roster`'s reason — a club that
  redeemed a batch in one sitting shares timestamps, and a cursor paginator
  whose sort key repeats can loop or skip. Read-only.
- **No client call site yet.** Nothing in `cloud.js` invokes it; the surface
  that consumes it is not built. Recorded here so it is not re-invented.

#### admin_reclaim_invite(p_user_id uuid, p_note text default null, p_older_than_days integer default 7) returns jsonb

- Purpose: return the invite an abandoned signup is holding to circulation,
  **without deleting the account**.
- Auth: `security definer`; `auth.uid()` first, then a real
  `profiles.is_admin` row — **not `is_staff()`** and not a permission code,
  because this un-memberships an account. `admin_remove_member()` and
  `admin_grant_coach()` take the same inline check for the same reason. Note
  the deliberate permission split with `admin_incomplete_signups()`: listing
  is staff, reclaiming is admin.
- Raises (all P0001, and every one of them means the admin is looking at a
  different situation than they think, so a UI must surface them by name):
  `not authorized`, `target account required`, `cannot reclaim your own
  invite`, `member has a profile` (a `profiles` row exists, even soft-deleted
  — `admin_remove_member` is the function they want), `no invite to reclaim`
  (no `invite_redemptions` row), `signup is still in progress` (redeemed
  inside the grace window).
- **`p_older_than_days` is a hard floor, not just a default.** It is
  `greatest(coalesce(p_older_than_days, 7), 1)`, so a caller passing 0 or a
  negative number gets one day, not "right now" — no amount of admin urgency
  can reclaim a code out from under someone who is on slide two of the
  carousel at that moment. Seven days is the default because an abandoned
  carousel is abandoned in minutes, and a member who comes back after a week
  to find their code spent has a worse day than the club has waiting a week.
- Side effects, exactly: a shared code gets `invite_codes.use_count`
  decremented, **floored at 0** (`use_count` is also that code's rate-limit
  counter and a negative one would hand out unlimited redemptions); a
  per-person invite has `redeemed_at`/`redeemed_by` cleared, which is
  precisely what `invite_status()` reads as `pending`, so the invite
  reappears in `admin_invite_list` as outstanding and the SAME code works
  again — unless it was revoked in the meantime, which is left revoked; the
  `invite_redemptions` row is deleted; the `POST_NEW_MEMBER` welcome post
  that redemption produced (`post_new_member_on_join`, 202608290014) is
  **soft**-deleted, because the club was told someone joined and they did
  not; one `invite_reclaimed` `admin_actions` row is written through
  `log_admin_action()`.
- **It never touches `auth.users`.** The account stays, signed-in sessions
  stay valid, and the member simply lands back on the invite screen, which is
  the correct place for someone no longer holding a redemption. Removing the
  redemption is also the one condition that was keeping an empty anonymous
  account out of `purge_abandoned_profiles()`, so afterwards that job
  collects it under its own retention window — see
  `docs/community/abandoned-profile-purge-runbook.md`.
- Returns jsonb `{user_id, invite_source, invite_id, released,
  welcome_posts_retracted, purgeable_by_purge_abandoned_profiles}`.
- **No client call site yet**, same as the listing function.

### `attendance_log` is self-reported training, not class attendance (202609060024)

A comment-only migration — no table, function, policy, grant or row is
touched — and it is recorded here because the claim it corrected had already
produced two real defects.

- **The claim.** `public.attendance_log`'s own table comment opened with
  "Verified class attendance", and three live function comments
  (`community_profile()`, `feed_leaderboard()`, `member_segments()`) repeated
  "verified attendance".
- **Why it is false.** `attendance_log` has exactly one writer, and it is not
  a turnstile, a coach or a booking system: it is the
  `private_records_attendance_log` trigger (202608310001), which fires on the
  member's OWN `private_records` rows of `record_type` `strength_entry` or
  `wod_entry` and writes one row per `(user_id, occurred_on)`. Every value in
  the table is **self-reported training the member typed into their own
  offline log**. Nothing verifies it, because nothing in this product could:
  class scheduling and check-in are Arbox's, which this app reads from and
  does not manage.
- **What the misnomer cost.** A privacy policy that told members their class
  attendance was recorded when no such record exists, and a coach dashboard
  that reported a box owner's most loyal members as never having trained.
- **What this does not change.** The column semantics, the trigger, the
  policies and every caller are exactly as they were. The data was never
  wrong; only the label on it. The `--` prose inside already-shipped
  migration files still says "verified attendance" in several places
  (202608310004, 202608290015, 202608280020, 202609010012); those files are
  immutable and are the historical record of what was believed when they were
  written.
- **The reading rule for this file and for every ticket title.** Wherever a
  Phase 3 ticket title or a line here says "verified attendance", read it as
  what "### What 'verified attendance' means" above already defines: derived
  server-side from the member's own private training log rather than proxied
  through an optional public post-share. It is **not** a physical check-in,
  not staff-confirmed, and "class" never belonged in the phrase at all.

## Weekly-challenge key integrity (202609060026–202609060027)

Two follow-ups to `fbf5a43`, which replaced the free-text
`comparison_key` field with a `<select>` and added two client-side checks:
the key's **shape**, and whether the key **names something the app's catalog
actually has**. Both are client-side, and `weekly_challenges` is INSERT-able
and UPDATE-able over PostgREST by any holder of `community.challenge.create`
(202609060005) — so the picker was an affordance, not a boundary.

### `weekly_challenges_comparison_key_shape` (202609060026)

- A **validated** `CHECK` on `public.weekly_challenges.comparison_key`,
  byte-for-byte `cloud.js`'s `COMPARISON_KEY_SHAPE_RE`:

```
^(movement:[a-z0-9-]+:(est1rm|duration)|wod:[a-z0-9-]+:[a-z]+:(rx|scaled))$
```

- **Deliberately not one character stricter than the client**, so the
  database can never refuse a key the shipped picker offers — including
  custom-WOD ids, which are `uid("customwod")` output
  (`customwod-<lower-case uuid>`).
- **It enforces SHAPE ONLY, and cannot enforce more.** The movement and WOD
  catalog lives in `src/constants.js` and in each device's own custom WODs;
  Postgres has never seen it and has no table to join against.
  `movement:not-a-real-lift:est1rm` passes this constraint and is exactly as
  dead as a Hebrew movement name was. **`challengeKeyExists()` in `cloud.js`
  remains the only check for that half and must not be removed on the
  grounds that "the database validates it now."** pgTAP 0088 pins this limit
  with a passing insert of a well-shaped ghost key, precisely so the
  constraint is not later read as more than it is.
- Applies on **UPDATE** as well, which is where the client has no say at all:
  `setWeeklyChallenge()` only ever INSERTs, while 202609060005 granted
  UPDATE so a coach could fix a typo. A `PATCH` to a malformed key is
  refused with `23514`.
- No notion of role. A coach and an admin are refused identically; this is a
  data-integrity rule, not a permission.
- `workout_posts.comparison_key` is **left unconstrained** on purpose:
  nullable, written by `publishWorkout()` across years of existing rows, and
  a malformed value there is inert (it simply never joins). A validated
  `CHECK` on it would risk aborting `supabase db push` against production
  rows for no security gain.

### `public.weekly_challenges_archive` (202609060026)

The rows that had to move before the constraint could be **validated** —
the six the five-persona UX audit found plus one seeded while verifying
`fbf5a43`, and on any other database whatever fails the same predicate.

- `(id, comparison_key, title, starts_on, ends_on, created_by, created_at,
  archived_at, archived_by_migration, archived_reason)`. Rows are copied
  **whole** and then deleted from `weekly_challenges`, in one transaction, so
  the removal is reversible in principle: restoring one is an INSERT with a
  corrected key, and the coach's title, dates and original `created_at`
  survive verbatim. `created_by` carries **no FK** — same reason
  `admin_actions.admin_id` has none (202609060022): the record must outlive
  the account, and a cascade would erase the evidence of the cleanup.
- RLS on. `grant select ... to authenticated` plus
  `weekly_challenges_archive_read` `using (has_perm('community.challenge
  .create'))` — the same permission that may create or delete a weekly
  challenge. **No INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE grant and no policy for them**: this
  table is written by migrations only, so a client can neither forge nor
  erase a removal. `anon` reaches nothing.
- **Why remove the rows rather than add the constraint `NOT VALID`.** A dead
  row is not passive here: `club_summary()` picks the active weekly challenge
  with `order by ends_on asc limit 1`, so a malformed row that ends sooner
  **shadows** a good one set alongside it — the club home advertises the
  broken challenge and the working one is invisible. The client's `valid`
  flag hides the hero but cannot un-shadow the good challenge.
- **What removing them costs, stated plainly.** A coach with a broken
  challenge currently sees the staff-only banner `cloud.js` renders from
  `weeklyChallengeRow.valid`; once the row is gone that banner stops
  appearing and the coach simply sees no active challenge. Judged worth it —
  the banner's job is to get a real challenge set, the Boards tab already
  reported these rows as "no active challenge", and no member ever saw them.
- **Nothing referenced the removed rows**, checked before deciding: no
  foreign key anywhere points at `weekly_challenges` (`chal_progress` and the
  whole `challenge_*` family belong to the separate Phase-2
  `public.challenges` table); `weekly_challenge_leaderboard` joins
  `workout_posts` on `comparison_key` text equality, which a malformed key
  matches zero of by construction; `club_summary()` and
  `loadWeeklyChallenge()` read by date window only.

### `club_summary()` returns the key (202609060027)

Signature unchanged; see the full return shape under **`club_summary()`**
above. `comparison_key` and `starts_at` are added inside `active_challenge`.

- **Why the key rather than a validity boolean.** A boolean computed in the
  database can only mean "the shape is valid", because shape is the only half
  Postgres can check — so the caller would still have had to fetch the key to
  finish the job and the round-trip would have survived. And after
  202609060026 that boolean is a **constant**: shape validity is now a table
  invariant, and a field that can only ever say `true` is decoration a later
  reader will mistake for a guarantee.
- **The key exposes nothing new.** `movement:back-squat:est1rm` is a content
  identifier, not member data, and every community member can already read it
  two ways — `weekly_challenges_read` (202609060011) is
  `using (is_community_member())` over the whole row, and
  `weekly_challenge_leaderboard` selects `comparison_key` by name. Making it
  staff-only here would have been theatre.
- The weekly branch selects the **same row and ordering** as
  `loadWeeklyChallenge()` (`current_date` inside the window,
  `order by ends_on asc limit 1`). The two must not drift, or the client
  would validate one row and render another.

### Client change this enables (not made here — `cloud.js` is owned elsewhere)

`loadWeeklyChallenge()` can drop its first query entirely and build
`state.club.weeklyChallengeRow` from `club_summary()`'s `active_challenge`
when `source === 'weekly'`, keeping `COMPARISON_KEY_SHAPE_RE &&
challengeKeyExists()` exactly as they are. **Both migrations are safe to land
without it** — the added keys are ignored by the shipped reader.

While reading that call site, two things worth a separate ticket, neither
fixable in the schema:

1. `renderClubHome()` gates the `club_summary`-sourced hero on
   `activeWeeklyChallenge()`, which only ever inspects the `weekly` row. A
   Phase-2 `challenges` hero (`source === 'challenge'`) would therefore be
   suppressed by an unrelated broken weekly row. Latent today because
   `challenges` is empty; `source` is in the payload and is the fix.
2. `challengeKeyExists()` is **device-relative** for custom WODs, which are
   local per-member data. A challenge set on coach A's custom WOD looks
   broken to coach B and invalid to every member. The database cannot help
   with this — a shared challenge needs a shared catalog.
   **Closed 2026-09-07 by `fbf5a43`, confirmed still closed 2026-09-15.** The
   fix was not a shared catalog for custom WODs but removing the ability to
   name one: `challengeKeyChoices()` skips `category === "Custom"` for
   movements and WODs alike, the field became a `<select>` over that list, and
   `setWeeklyChallenge()` re-checks membership of the same list so the DOM
   cannot be edited around it. Published club programming is the shared-catalog
   half, and `202609060028` already covers it.
   `test/community-weekly-challenge.test.mjs` is the regression test.

## The feed writes itself: club WOD sessions and boards (202609080001–202609080002)

The one product change out of the five-persona audit plus market research.
The finding: **the community layer competes with WhatsApp on typed posts and
loses** — 99% penetration, 99% daily use, and the box already has a group.
The second, structural finding: every computed community surface is fed by
`attendance_log`, which is trigger-written from the training log, so
community was gated on log adoption and log adoption was meant to be driven
by community.

The answer built here is a card that is worth reading at **zero member
contributions** — a coach programs a catalogue WOD to a day, and members
attach results they have **already logged** with one tap instead of composing
anything.

Two migrations because `ALTER TYPE ... ADD VALUE` cannot be used in the
transaction that adds it. `202609080001` adds `POST_CLUB_WOD` and nothing
else; `202609080002` is the feature. Same split, same reason, as
`202608280004`/`202608280005`.

### New tables

| table | grants | policy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `public.club_wod_sessions` | `select` to `authenticated` only | `club_wod_sessions_read`: `is_community_member()` |
| `public.club_wod_results` | `select` to `authenticated` only | `club_wod_results_read`: `is_community_member() and (user_id = auth.uid() or can_view_profile_field(user_id, 'show_workout_results'))` |

Neither table has an `insert`, `update` or `delete` grant for any client
role. Every write is a definer RPC below.

`club_wod_results` has **no `score_value`, `score_direction`, `rank` or
`position`** — the anti-leaderboard decision made structural rather than
promised in a comment. `weekly_challenges` remains the ranked feature.

### Functions

```
public.club_wod_session_publish(
  p_wod_id text,
  p_session_date date default null,
  p_note text default '',
  p_idempotency_key uuid default null
) returns jsonb                                       -- the board
```
Programs one catalogue WOD to one day. Creates the `club_wod_sessions` row
and its single `POST_CLUB_WOD` card. **Auth:** definer; `auth.uid()`
(`not authorized`) → `is_community_member()` (`recovery method required`) →
`has_perm('community.challenge.create')` (`not authorized`). **Raises:**
`wod not found`, `wod is retired`,
`a session can only be posted for yesterday, today or tomorrow`,
`too many sessions posted for that day` (cap 4 live per date),
`session already posted` (same `(wod_id, session_date)` with a **changed**
note — `club_wod_publish`'s snapshot rule; an identical note returns the
existing board and writes nothing). Re-publishing a **cancelled** session
clears the cancellation, mints a fresh card and keeps the board.
**Side effects:** one session row created or revived, one `workout_posts`
row, one `admin_actions` row (`club_wod_session_published` /
`club_wod_session`, `target_user_id` null).

```
public.club_wod_session_cancel(p_session_id uuid, p_reason text default null)
  returns jsonb                                       -- the board
```
Withdraws the card (`workout_posts.deleted_at` only, `status` left `active`)
and closes the board. **Deletes nothing.** Same three gates. Raises
`session not found`; cancelling twice is a no-op with no second audit row.
Audits `club_wod_session_cancelled`.

```
public.club_wod_attach_result(
  p_session_id uuid,
  p_record_id text,
  p_entry jsonb default null,
  p_idempotency_key uuid default null
) returns jsonb                                       -- the board
```
Attaches the **caller's own** logged result. **Auth:** definer; `auth.uid()`
→ `is_community_member()` → `has_perm('community.post.create')` →
`is_posting_restricted` (`posting_restricted`). **Raises:**
`session not found`, `this board is closed` (cancelled, or over 14 days old),
`the session has not happened yet`, `record is required`, `not authorized`
(the record id is another member's `wod_entry`),
`that result is for a different workout` (the entry's `wodId` is not this
session's, or is absent), `rate_limited` (20 per 10 minutes on its **own**
`club_wod_attach` key, never `post_create`'s). The figure is
**recomputed, never trusted**: `wod_entry_result_text(wod_entry_normalize(...))`
over the caller's own `private_records` row, falling back to `p_entry` only
when no server copy of that id exists (cloud backup is opt-out). With
neither, the attach succeeds with `result_text` null. Idempotent twice over:
`p_idempotency_key` (whose replay **re-reads** the board) and the natural
`(session_id, user_id)` primary key. A second attach replaces the figure
**without bumping `attached_at`**. Writes no `admin_actions` row.

```
public.club_wod_detach_result(p_session_id uuid) returns jsonb   -- the board
```
Removes the caller's own row. **Auth:** `auth.uid()` then
`is_community_member()` and nothing else — deliberately no permission check,
no restriction check and no window check. Raises `session not found`;
detaching twice is a success.

```
public.club_wod_board(p_session_id uuid) returns jsonb
public.club_wod_boards(p_from date default null, p_to date default null) returns setof jsonb
```
Reads, both definer with `auth.uid()` then `is_community_member()`.
`club_wod_board` raises `session not found` and **returns cancelled sessions
too** (a member with a result on a withdrawn board must still see it and
detach). `club_wod_boards()` **with no arguments means today** — that is the
club-home call; `p_to` defaults to `p_from`; a reversed range collapses to
one day and a span over 14 is truncated to `p_from + 13`; cancelled sessions
are excluded.

Internal, **no client grant**: `club_wod_board_json(uuid)` (the one
definition of a board, shared by the two reads and all four writes),
`wod_entry_normalize(jsonb)`, `wod_entry_result_text(jsonb)`.

### The board shape

Every key is always present, so the empty, cancelled and not-yet-attached
states need no absence tests.

```
{ session_id, session_date, note, post_id, published_at,
  published_by: { id, display_name, handle, avatar_url } | null,
  cancelled_at,
  wod: <club_wod_json shape> | null,
  result_count,                     -- viewer-relative, see below
  results: [ { user_id, display_name, handle, avatar_url, is_viewer,
               result_text, result_hidden, score_type, rx,
               occurred_on, attached_at } ],
  viewer: { attached, result_text, score_type, rx, occurred_on, attached_at,
            can_attach, can_detach,
            closed_reason: null | 'future' | 'expired' | 'cancelled' } }
```

`results` is ordered by `attached_at` — the order people trained in, never
anything score-shaped.

### Privacy: participation and the figure are two different permissions

| what | gate | default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| listed on the board at all | `can_view_profile_field(member, 'visible_to_club')` | true |
| `result_text` populated | `can_view_profile_field(member, 'show_workout_results')` | **false** |

This is COMM-018's rule, applied to a board: the toggle **strips the
number, it does not remove the member**. `can_view_profile_field` settles
block edges in both directions and the self case in the same call.

`result_count` is counted over the **same filtered set** as `results`, so no
aggregate discloses a member the viewer may not see.

The RLS policy on `club_wod_results` is deliberately **stricter** than the
read RPC: a direct PostgREST select returns only the caller's own rows and
rows whose owner's `show_workout_results` they may view. The definer RPC
crosses that boundary in one direction only — to reveal *less* than the row.

Two consequences worth stating:

- **The shipped default is a board of names with few numbers**, until
  members opt in. `show_workout_results` defaults false and eleven
  server-enforced toggles are the audit's best-rated thing in this product.
  **The client must not flip it, or offer to flip it.** The only correct
  affordance is a link to the privacy screen.
- **A coach cannot read a member's figure either.**
  `can_view_profile_field` short-circuits for `is_admin()` (rank ≥ 50), not
  `is_staff()`. A coach sees who took part, which is what a coach needs from
  this board.

**Nothing auto-publishes.** There is no trigger from `private_records`,
`attendance_log` or `workout_posts` to `club_wod_results` and there must
never be one — asserted as a catalog property in
`0091_club_wod_sessions_test.sql`, not as a convention.

### `POST_CLUB_WOD` (202609080001)

Added to `public.post_type` and to
`workout_posts_guard_privileged_type()`'s privileged list, so a member
cannot mint or PATCH a card the client renders as club programming.
`feed_page` is **not** recreated: the label falls to diversity class
`'other'`, which is correct — `'workout'` is the run-suppression class and
is also what `feed_page`'s `hide_result` lateral keys on, and `'boost'`
exists to break workout runs, which a once-a-day card cannot be relied on to
do. The card is already lifted by `author_is_staff`.

### Client changes this enables (not made here — `cloud.js`/`app.js` owned elsewhere)

1. `loadClubWodBoards()` calling `club_wod_boards()` for the club-home
   "today" strip, and `club_wod_board(sessionId)` from a `POST_CLUB_WOD`
   feed card (`metadata.club_wod_session_id`).
2. `renderPostCard` must branch on `post_type === 'POST_CLUB_WOD'` **before**
   its `data-source-type` deep link: `source_type` is null on these rows and
   the default is `'workout'`, which would open the wrong thing.
3. An attach control in the WOD log form, passing the entry the client
   already holds as `p_entry` so a member with cloud backup off still gets a
   figure.
4. A detach control, and a "your result is hidden from the club" hint that
   **links to** the privacy screen rather than offering to change the
   toggle.

Out of scope, deliberately: programming a whole week at once (a scheduling
feature; the one-day window is what bounds the feed), a "hide this one
number" per-row flag (a twelfth toggle would fragment a model members
already understand — detach is the per-row control), and paging the board
(one board is one club-day).

## An announcement becomes its feed card (202609220007)

### Trigger announcements_feed_card_insert → announcement_feed_card_insert()

- AFTER INSERT on `announcements`, SECURITY DEFINER, not callable by any
  client role. Writes one `POST_ANNOUNCEMENT` row in the same transaction:
  `author_id` **null**, `visibility = 'club'`, `status = 'active'`,
  `published_at` = the announcement's `created_at`, `title` = its title,
  `body` = `left(body, 1000)`, `source_type = 'announcement'`,
  `source_id` = the announcement's id, `occurred_on` = `created_at::date`,
  `metadata` = `{title, announcement_id, priority}`.
- `metadata.announcement_id` is the key `feed_page()`'s chronological order
  (202609220003) resolves `announcements.expires_at` through: the card is in
  the coach tier until the announcement expires, then falls to the stream.
  With no expiry it takes the `coach_top_hours` fallback.
- Writes nothing when the row is already soft-deleted, already expired, or
  while `club_features.announcements` is off.
- One card per announcement: `workout_posts_announcement_card_idx`, a partial
  unique index on `metadata ->> 'announcement_id'` for `POST_ANNOUNCEMENT`.
- Takes `app.allow_unrated_post_insert` around its one INSERT and restores the
  previous value: publishing an announcement spends no `post_create` token.
- No new policy, grant or RPC. Who may publish is still
  `announcements_insert_admin` (`is_staff()`).
- No backfill of announcements written before this migration.

### Trigger announcements_feed_card_sync → announcement_feed_card_sync()

- AFTER UPDATE OF `title, body, priority, deleted_at` OR DELETE on
  `announcements`. A soft-delete or a hard delete soft-deletes the card (under
  `app.allow_moderation_write`, restored afterwards); a title, body or
  priority edit is copied onto it. `expires_at` is not copied — the feed reads
  it live.

### Client

None. `postAnnouncement()` in `src/community/club.js` inserts the row as
before; `renderAnnouncementPostCard` already rendered an authorless
`POST_ANNOUNCEMENT` with `metadata.title`.
