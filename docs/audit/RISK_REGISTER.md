# Risk register — reconciled audit findings

> **Addendum, written after this document, same session.** A later
> implementation pass in this same audit session fixed several items this
> register lists as STILL_OPEN or PARTIAL — most notably
> `AUDIT0827-OPS-H4`/`RESCAN-H5` (the unscheduled `purge_due_accounts()`),
> which is now scheduled (see `CORRECTIONS_COMPLETED.md` item 4). **This
> register was not re-run against those fixes** — it reflects the state at
> the moment it was written, before the implementation pass. Treat
> `REMEDIATION_ROADMAP.md` as the current, reconciled-against-fixes source
> of truth for what remains open; use this document for its original
> purpose (verified provenance of each finding back to the 3 prior audits)
> rather than as a live open/closed tracker.

Date: 2026-09-06
Repo state audited: branch `main`, HEAD `d2e6408` ("Close every finding from the full
launch-readiness audit"), working tree clean apart from `.claude/settings.local.json`.
App version 4.3.0 (`APP_VERSION` and `SW_VERSION` in sync, `npm run check-version` OK).

Sources reconciled:

- `2026-08-27-full-application-audit.md` (`AUDIT0827-*`)
- `2026-08-27-remediation-rescan.md` (`RESCAN-*`)
- `2026-09-02-design-sync-and-cross-repo-audit.md` (`DSYNC-*`)
- `docs/community/backlog.md` + `docs/community/tickets/COMM-*.md` (open-status sweep)
- New items found while verifying (`AUDIT-RECON-*`)

Every row below was checked against the **current** code, not against the source
document's own claim. Where a document said "fixed", the current file:line was re-read;
where it said "open", the current file:line was re-read too.

## Test suite baseline

`npm test` (`node --test`, Node v22.23.1) at `d2e6408`:

```
# tests 1108
# pass 1107
# fail 0
# cancelled 0
# skipped 1
# todo 0
# duration_ms 45546
```

**Unchanged from the stated baseline** — 1108 tests, 1107 pass, 1 pre-existing skip,
0 fail. `node_modules` was already complete; no `npm ci` was needed.

The other two CI gates were **not** re-run in this pass (both need Docker/Playwright):
`migration-check` (`supabase start` + `supabase test db`, 77 pgTAP files) and
`browser-checks` (`scripts/browser-check/run-all.mjs`, 29 scenarios). `d2e6408`'s commit
message claims `Files=77, Tests=2686, PASS` and `29/29` respectively; the file counts
match what is on disk (77 files in `supabase/tests/`, 29 scenario scripts in
`scripts/browser-check/`), so the claim is structurally consistent but is **not**
independently re-verified here.

## Counts

| Status | Rows |
|---|---:|
| VERIFIED_FIXED | 75 |
| STILL_OPEN | 54 |
| PARTIAL | 50 |
| NO_LONGER_APPLICABLE | 15 |
| **Total rows reconciled** | **194** |

Of the 194 rows, 7 are newly minted `AUDIT-RECON-*` items found during verification.

The three source documents overlap heavily — the 2026-08-27 rescan restates most of the
2026-08-27 audit's open items, and the 2026-09-02 audit re-found several of both. Every
finding is kept as its own row so no source document is silently dropped, with duplicates
cross-referenced in Notes. **After deduplication the open work is 54 distinct items: 31
STILL_OPEN and 23 PARTIAL** (AUDIT0827-PROD-3 resolved 2026-09-10, see item 29 below;
RESCAN-H5/AUDIT0827-OPS-H4 - one distinct item, the two rows were already cross-referenced
as duplicates of each other - resolved 2026-09-10 too, see item 1 above),
which is exactly what the punch list below enumerates. Use the punch list, not the raw
row counts, for planning.

## Commit-scope spot checks

| Commit | Message claim | Actual diff | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| `60158de` | "Close all 14 launch-readiness audit findings" — 5 migrations, 1 Edge Function, 2 pgTAP files, client fixes, PRIVACY disclosure, 6 stale fixtures | 20 files, +2498/-37; all 5 named migrations present (`202609050001`–`0005`), `supabase/functions/admin_reset_password/index.ts` present, `0063`/`0064` pgTAP files present, `PRIVACY.md`+`privacy.html` touched, 6 test fixture files touched | **Scope matches.** Claimed test numbers (1035/1036) are superseded by the current 1108. |
| `8742369` | "Bump app version to 4.0.2 so the PWA actually ships today's fixes" | 2 files, 2 lines (`app.js`, `sw.js`) | **Scope matches.** Superseded — current version is 4.3.0. |
| `c39f640` | "Implement the redesign mockup: Manage tab, feature flags, intro carousel" | 30 files, +1560/-145; 2 migrations (`202609050006`, `202609050007`), 2 pgTAP files, `community-intro-carousel` browser scenario + node test, cloud.js +518 | **Scope matches.** |
| `d2e6408` | "Close every finding from the full launch-readiness audit" — RLS lockdown, 2 new RPCs, redesign bugs, broken features, docs/legal, offline/sync, QA backfill; 4.2.1→4.3.0 | 54 files, +7757/-335; 10 migrations (`202609060001`–`0010`), 10 new/changed pgTAP files, 20 test files, `PRIVACY.md`/`privacy.html`/`sw.js`/`contracts.md` touched | **Scope matches.** The headline claim (anonymous-read confidentiality gap) is real and closed — see `AUDIT-RECON-001`. |

Note: none of these four commits is traceable to a ticket ID in
`docs/community/backlog.md` — see `AUDIT-RECON-006`.

## Punch list — every STILL_OPEN and PARTIAL item

Use this as the implementation todo list. Ordered roughly by risk.

### STILL_OPEN

1. ~~**RESCAN-H5 / AUDIT0827-OPS-H4**~~ — RESOLVED, `202609060011` (one migration after
   the one this row originally cited) scheduled `purge-due-accounts` at `59 3 * * *`;
   confirmed live and active on the production project 2026-09-10. This row is exactly
   what the document-level addendum at the top of this file already warned about -
   left here, struck through, so a reader who skips the addendum and jumps straight to
   the punch list still sees the correction.
2. **AUDIT0827-OPS-H1 / RESCAN-H4** — No deployment workflow. `.github/workflows/` holds
   only `test.yml`; no artifact packaging, staging, smoke test, approval, or rollback.
3. **DSYNC-SEC-2 / COMM-338** — Live/production RLS behaviour never verified against a
   real project. `scripts/smoke-test-multi-role.mjs` ran for the first time on
   2026-09-22, but against a **local** stack at 178 migrations (the same count
   `npm run check:drift` reports for production), not against the live project: 18 of its
   19 assertions passed, and the single failure was a bug in the script itself
   (`private_records?select=id` — no such column; the table is keyed
   `(user_id, record_type, record_id)`), fixed 2026-09-22. So the script is now known to
   work; the deployed project is still unverified (no staging project, no provisioned
   test accounts).
4. **AUDIT0827-QA-4** — No end-to-end community test against a live/staging environment.
5. **AUDIT0827-SEC-M4 / RESCAN-M1 / DSYNC-SEC-1 / COMM-337** — Clickjacking headers still
   inert. GitHub Pages cannot send `frame-ancestors`/`X-Frame-Options`; the meta tag is
   spec-ignored for those directives.
6. **AUDIT0827-OPS-M5 / RESCAN-M10** — Environment config still hard-coded and tracked in
   `cloud-config.js`; no staging/production discrimination, no visible staging marker.
7. **AUDIT0827-OPS-M8** — No operational monitoring: no client error reporting sink, no
   uptime/synthetic checks, no sync-failure/outbox-age/purge-status metrics, no incident
   owner. `src/analytics.js` writes product events to Postgres only.
8. **AUDIT0827-OPS-M9 / RESCAN-M11** — No service backup/recovery definition, no RPO/RTO,
   no restore drill evidence anywhere in the repo.
9. **AUDIT0827-OPS-M7 (part) / DSYNC-SEC-4** — Supply chain: no SBOM, no scheduled online
   advisory scan, no Dependabot config, no checksum/integrity check on
   `vendor/supabase.js` (only a version-string comparison).
10. **AUDIT0827-ARCH-1** — `app.js` is still a monolith: 4,467 lines / 243 KB.
11. **AUDIT0827-ARCH-2 / DSYNC-ARCH-1** — `cloud.js` is still one file mixing network,
    state, auth gates, uploads, sync and rendering: 12,501 lines / 841 KB (grew from
    10,405 / ~700 KB since the 2026-09-02 audit).
12. **AUDIT0827-ARCH-5** — No backup schema version or IndexedDB migration policy; no
    per-version backup fixtures.
13. **AUDIT0827-ARCH-6** — Frontend and database releases still uncoupled; no
    forward/backward schema compatibility rule during rollout.
14. **AUDIT0827-QA-6** — Offline recovery fault injection still thin (quota is now
    covered; partial cache, IDB denial, corrupt records, clock skew, interrupted upgrades
    are not).
15. **AUDIT0827-QA-7 / RESCAN-L5 / DSYNC-QA-1** — No cross-browser support matrix; the
    browser suite is Chromium-only.
16. **AUDIT0827-QA-5 (part)** — No axe/automated accessibility scan and no 320 CSS px or
    200% reflow browser check (`text-scale.mjs` runs at 390 px).
17. **AUDIT0827-PERF-1** — No performance budgets defined or measured anywhere.
18. **DSYNC-PERF-3** — No dynamic `import()`/code splitting; 841 KB of `cloud.js` is
    parsed synchronously on every load.
19. **DSYNC-PERF-4** — `cloud.js` is unminified with no minify step.
20. **DSYNC-PERF-5** — No unified offline/degraded-mode banner for the community layer.
21. **DSYNC-PERF-7** — 12 sequential `<script>` tags, no `async`/`defer`, fragile
    `src/*` ordering (`index.html:1087-1102`).
22. **DSYNC-PERF-9** — No manifest shortcut into `?tab=community` despite the tab now
    being a first-class bottom-bar tab.
23. **DSYNC-ARCH-3** — `isIOSDevice()` still duplicated verbatim between `app.js:4057`
    and `cloud.js:10113`.
24. **DSYNC-ARCH-4** — `render()`'s single try/catch still has no error classification or
    reporting hook beyond `console.error`.
25. **DSYNC-ARCH-7** — No documented convention for silent-catch vs. user-visible-error
    handling in `cloud.js`.
26. **AUDIT0827-UX-8 / RESCAN-M5 / DSYNC-A11Y-6** — Calendar still has no grid semantics,
    no `aria-current`, no roving focus, no Arrow-key day navigation.
27. **AUDIT0827-UX-15 / RESCAN-L2** — Essential secondary text still at 11–13 px in many
    places; no rem token scale for body copy.
28. **AUDIT0827-PROD-1** — No product success criteria/targets (activation, retention,
    backup, sync). `docs/community/metrics.md` defines community *events*, not targets.
29. **AUDIT0827-PROD-3** — RESOLVED 2026-09-10: the intro carousel's `club_rules` step
    now states the actual defaults (profile visible, numbers private until shared).
30. **AUDIT0827-PROD-6** — No in-app feedback/support route carrying release version and
    diagnostic context.
31. **AUDIT0827-SEC-L8 / DSYNC-CONTENT-5** — Plaintext JSON export still has no
    shared-device warning in the UI or in PRIVACY.md, and no encrypted-backup option.
32. **AUDIT-RECON-002** — Backlog/ticket status bookkeeping has drifted badly enough that
    the backlog cannot be used as a launch gate.
33. **AUDIT-RECON-003** — `events.image_url` and sibling `image_url` columns carry a
    length-only CHECK; no URL-scheme check, unlike `events.map_link` and
    `profiles.avatar_url`.

### PARTIAL

34. **AUDIT0827-QA-3 / DSYNC-QA-4** — Two-user RLS testing exists (77 pgTAP files) but
    has never been validated against the live project; storage-object policies are not
    exercised by pgTAP at all.
35. **DSYNC-A11Y-2 / COMM-329** — Headings and landmarks: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`
    and per-tab `<h1>` shipped, but there is no `<footer>` landmark, the bottom tablist
    is not inside a `<nav>`, `<main>`'s tabpanel has no `aria-labelledby`, community
    screens have only 5 headings across 12.5 K lines, and no axe scan exists.
36. **AUDIT0827-UX-5 / RESCAN-M2** — Contrast: `--brass` and `--steel` were fixed and
    `brass-contrast.test.mjs` pins `--brass`, but there is still no test covering *every*
    theme token pair as the rescan asked.
37. **AUDIT0827-UX-3 / RESCAN-M3** — Text enlargement still uses CSS `zoom`
    (`index.html:190`), not rem-based type tokens; `#app` still carries
    `overflow-x:hidden` (`index.html:212`).
38. **AUDIT0827-ARCH-7 / RESCAN-L1** — Desktop: a `@media (min-width:900px)` block and a
    desktop sidebar shipped, but content is still capped at 480 px inside it; history,
    charts and coach tools have no wide layout.
39. **AUDIT0827-ARCH-4 / DSYNC-ARCH-1** — `cloud.js` state is now namespaced (COMM-365)
    but is still one flat mutable object with no store/controller boundary.
40. **AUDIT0827-ARCH-3 / DSYNC-ARCH-2 / COMM-366** — Full-tree `innerHTML` rerender was
    spiked and deliberately kept; the manual focus-restoration subsystem it forces still
    exists.
41. **AUDIT0827-UX-10 / RESCAN-M7** — Photo alt text works on the `post_media` path
    (composer captures it, `cloud.js:6211`), but the legacy single-photo fallback card
    still renders `alt=""` (`cloud.js:11151`).
42. **AUDIT0827-UX-11 / RESCAN-M8 / COMM-359** — Charts got `role="img"` + a computed
    Hebrew summary, but still have no adjacent data table/list alternative.
43. **AUDIT0827-UX-9 / RESCAN-M6** — Form errors: `field()` wires
    `aria-invalid`/`aria-describedby` in `cloud.js:4377-4385`, but app.js's WOD builder
    only sets `aria-invalid` with no `aria-describedby`, and first-error focus is not
    universal.
44. **AUDIT0827-UX-1 / RESCAN-H2 / DSYNC-A11Y-1** — All 10 app dialogs are registered on
    `APP_DIALOGS` with Escape + Tab trap + focus restore, but background regions are
    never marked `inert` (zero `inert` usage in the codebase).
45. **AUDIT0827-UX-2 / RESCAN-H3 / DSYNC-A11Y-3** — Tablist keyboard support shipped for
    every `role="tablist"`, but the desktop-sidebar rows (`app.js:195`) carry
    `role="tab"` without roving `tabindex` and without a `role="tablist"` parent.
46. **AUDIT0827-OPS-M7 (actions)** — GitHub Actions are SHA-pinned and CI cancels
    superseded runs; the rest of the supply-chain program (item 9 above) is not done.
47. **AUDIT0827-PROD-4** — Recovery: a staleness banner (`app.js:3046`), auto-backup
    before destructive actions and private cloud sync all shipped, but there is still no
    explicit statement of whether cloud sync is a recovery feature.
48. **DSYNC-DT-4 / COMM-353** — `.page-title` typography reconciliation is one-sided;
    Community is correct, `crossfit-pwa-Noam` never got the backport.
49. **DSYNC-DT-2 / COMM-351** — `--shadow-card` formula reconciliation: same, Noam-side
    only.
50. **DSYNC-DT-5 / COMM-354** — `--steel` reconciliation: same, Noam-side only.
51. **DSYNC-ARCH-6 / COMM-368** — Shared safety helpers extracted to
    `src/shared/safe-helpers.js` inside this repo, but there is still no shared
    package/submodule reaching `crossfit-pwa-Noam`.
52. **DSYNC-COMM-3 / COMM-347** — CSS-class extraction landed for the high-traffic
    components, but `cloud.js`'s inline `style="` count went **up**, 722 → 780.
53. **COMM-143** — Phase 1 notification trigger set: the client renders every type, but
    the backlog still records the server trigger set as partial.
54. **AUDIT0827-QA-9** — Backup compatibility fixtures: sanitizer/import tests are strong
    but there are no per-schema-version backup fixtures.
55. **DSYNC-FEAT-6** — The ~11 smaller `crossfit-pwa-Noam` 2026-09-02 bug fixes were
    never individually re-verified against Community's diverged UI.
56. **AUDIT-RECON-005** — Legal documents are placeholder-free and honest, but the
    ticket's own acceptance criterion (recorded legal sign-off) is explicitly still
    outside the repo.

### Source: 2026-08-27 full application audit — Product

| ID | Source | Priority | Category | Finding | Current evidence | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| AUDIT0827-PROD-1 | AUDIT0827 | High | Product | No measurable success criteria | `docs/community/metrics.md:1-40` defines tracked events + WCAM but no activation/retention/backup targets | STILL_OPEN | Event taxonomy is real and disciplined; the *targets* half was never written. |
| AUDIT0827-PROD-2 | AUDIT0827 | High | Product | Coach model is global, not roster-scoped | `supabase/migrations/202608280001_clubs_and_rbac.sql:38,238`; `admin_member_roster` (COMM-377) is admin-scoped, not coach-to-class | NO_LONGER_APPLICABLE | RBAC ranks + permission strings replaced the flat "coach" tier. Class-to-coach scoping is Arbox's domain by explicit product boundary, not this app's. |
| AUDIT0827-PROD-3 | AUDIT0827 | Medium | Product | Onboarding does not explain local vs. cloud vs. public data | `supabase/migrations/202609100001_intro_carousel_data_visibility_disclosure.sql` adds one accurate sentence to the `club_rules` intro-carousel step | VERIFIED_FIXED | Copy matches `PRIVACY.md`'s actual defaults (profile visible, workout results/PRs/attendance private until shared) rather than a vague "your data becomes public" overstatement. Shown before profile completion, still before `privacy.html` would otherwise be reached. |
| AUDIT0827-PROD-4 | AUDIT0827 | Medium | Product | Recovery depends on user-managed JSON exports | `app.js:3046` staleness banner; `app.js:1653,1708` auto-backup before destructive ops; private cloud sync shipped | PARTIAL | Visible backup status and guidance landed; the "is cloud sync a recovery feature" decision is still unstated. |
| AUDIT0827-PROD-5 | AUDIT0827 | Medium | Product | Moderation workflow incomplete | `cloud.js:2253` `REPORT_REASONS`, `cloud.js:5074` mod queue, `cloud.js:11912` queue actions, `admin_actions` audit table | VERIFIED_FIXED | Reasons, queue, review/resolve/dismiss and audit writes all ship (COMM-151..154). Appeals/sanctions policy is still a product decision, not a code gap. |
| AUDIT0827-PROD-6 | AUDIT0827 | Medium | Product | No formal feedback channel | No feedback/support route in `app.js` or `cloud.js`; PRIVACY.md points at "contact your coach directly" | STILL_OPEN | The human channel is documented; the in-app route with version + diagnostics is not built. |

### Source: 2026-08-27 full application audit — Architecture

| ID | Source | Priority | Category | Finding | Current evidence | Status | Notes |

| AUDIT0827-ARCH-2 | AUDIT0827 | High | Architecture | `cloud.js` mixes network, state, authz, uploads, sync, rendering | `cloud.js` is now 841,432 bytes / 12,501 lines | STILL_OPEN | Grew ~20% since the 2026-09-02 audit measured 10,405 lines. |
| AUDIT0827-ARCH-3 | AUDIT0827 | Medium | Architecture | Large DOM regions replaced via `innerHTML` | `docs/community/2026-09-03-render-architecture-spike.md`; `cloud.js` rerender pattern retained | PARTIAL | COMM-366 spiked scoped rendering and deliberately kept the full rerender, with measurements (`scripts/browser-check/community-render-cost.mjs`). Documented decision, not an oversight — but the focus-restoration subsystem it forces still exists. |
| AUDIT0827-ARCH-4 | AUDIT0827 | Medium | Architecture | Global mutable state drives most screens | `cloud.js:135-237` — state is namespaced by domain (COMM-365) but still one flat object | PARTIAL | Namespacing landed; no store/controller boundary. |
| AUDIT0827-ARCH-5 | AUDIT0827 | Medium | Architecture | No schema version strategy for local records | No `schemaVersion`/`BACKUP_VERSION` anywhere in `src/sanitize.js` or `src/db.js` | STILL_OPEN | Sanitizers are strong; versioning/migration policy is absent. |
| AUDIT0827-ARCH-6 | AUDIT0827 | Medium | Architecture | Frontend and database releases not coupled | `.github/workflows/test.yml` has no deploy stage; no compatibility rule documented | STILL_OPEN | |

| AUDIT0827-SEC-M3 | AUDIT0827 | Medium | Security | Unbounded upload path for any authenticated user | `202608270006_security_hardening.sql` storage policies require an active profile + redemption; 20-object post-photo quota | VERIFIED_FIXED | Aggregate byte budget still absent — tracked as RESCAN-L4. |
| AUDIT0827-SEC-M4 | AUDIT0827 | Medium | Security | Clickjacking defense ineffective on the static host | `index.html:19-31` documents the limitation; `index.html:48` `frame-ancestors 'none'` present in meta (spec-ignored there) | STILL_OPEN | Needs a hosting/edge change. Ticket COMM-337, status `todo`. |
| AUDIT0827-SEC-M5 | AUDIT0827 | Medium | Security | Reporting lacks trusted moderator status transitions | `202608270006_security_hardening.sql:226-244` `review_report()`; later reshaped by `202608280025`; client queue `cloud.js:5074`, `cloud.js:11912` | VERIFIED_FIXED | |

| AUDIT0827-SEC-L7 | AUDIT0827 | Low | Security | CSP permits every Supabase project | `index.html:41-42` — `img-src`/`connect-src` name the exact project host `jajmlyrjlkhclgphbfbb.supabase.co` (+ `wss:`) | VERIFIED_FIXED | CSP reporting endpoint still absent (low). |
| AUDIT0827-SEC-L8 | AUDIT0827 | Low | Privacy | Device data and JSON backups remain plaintext | `app.js:1574,1591` `downloadBackup()` with no warning; no plaintext/shared-device language in `PRIVACY.md` or `privacy.html` | STILL_OPEN | Also flagged independently as DSYNC-CONTENT-5. |
| AUDIT0827-SEC-L9 | AUDIT0827 | Low | Security | Staff status enumerable for arbitrary user IDs | `202608280001_clubs_and_rbac.sql:238` `is_staff()` takes no argument; `:242-243` revoked from public/anon | VERIFIED_FIXED | |

### Source: 2026-08-27 full application audit — UI, UX and accessibility

| ID | Source | Priority | Category | Finding | Current evidence | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| AUDIT0827-UX-1 | AUDIT0827 | High | Accessibility | Modal behaviour inconsistent for keyboard users | `app.js:3710-3739` `APP_DIALOGS` + Escape/Tab-trap handler; `app.js:3814-3859` registers all 10 overlays; opener storage + focus restore present (40 `openerEl` references) | PARTIAL | Escape policy, focus trap, initial focus and restore all ship (COMM-328/349). Background `inert` was asked for and never implemented — zero `inert` usages repo-wide. |
| AUDIT0827-UX-2 | AUDIT0827 | High | Accessibility | Tab controls lack expected keyboard behaviour | `app.js:3760-3795` generic tablist handler (Arrow/Home/End, RTL-aware, re-finds selected tab after rerender); roving `tabindex` at `app.js:128`, `app.js:3613-3615`, `cloud.js:11141`, `:11328`, `:11414`; `test/tablist-keyboard.test.mjs` | PARTIAL | Community subtabs are now real tabs too. Remaining gap: the desktop-sidebar rows (`app.js:195`) carry `role="tab"` without roving `tabindex` or a `role="tablist"` parent. |
| AUDIT0827-UX-3 | AUDIT0827 | High | Accessibility | Text enlargement uses CSS `zoom` with hidden overflow | `index.html:190` `html[data-text-scale="large"]{zoom:var(--text-scale)}`; `index.html:212` `#app{...overflow-x:hidden}` | PARTIAL | `--text-scale` restored to 1.2 (COMM-352), `overflow-x:hidden` removed from `body`/`.app-shell` with a documented rationale (`index.html:166-177`), and `text-scale.mjs` checks overflow. Still `zoom`-based, and no 320 px / 200% reflow check. |
| AUDIT0827-UX-4 | AUDIT0827 | Medium | Accessibility | Focus styles do not cover all interactive elements | `index.html:191` — `button, input, textarea, select, a, [tabindex]` all get `:focus-visible` outline | VERIFIED_FIXED | |
| AUDIT0827-UX-5 | AUDIT0827 | Medium | Accessibility | Secondary text contrast fails WCAG AA | `index.html:99` `--steel:#57627A` light, `:135`/`:148` `#A8B3C9` both dark paths; `index.html:105` `--brass:#956529` (5.03:1); `test/brass-contrast.test.mjs` | PARTIAL | Both named failures fixed and one is test-pinned. The rescan's "test which checks every theme token pair" was not built. |
| AUDIT0827-UX-6 | AUDIT0827 | Medium | Accessibility | Core landmarks and headings missing | `index.html:767` `<nav id="desktopSidebar">`, `:769` `<header>`, `:791` `<main>`, `:817` `<nav class="modal-list">`; `app.js:205-209` `renderTabHeader()` emits `<h1 class="page-title">`; `test/heading-outline.test.mjs` | PARTIAL | See DSYNC-A11Y-2 / COMM-329 for the exact residue (no `<footer>`, tablist outside `<nav>`, unlabelled tabpanel, community screens uncovered). |
| AUDIT0827-UX-7 | AUDIT0827 | Medium | Accessibility | Dynamic screen changes lack focus movement or announcements | `index.html:791` `#content` has `role="tabpanel"` and `aria-controls` from each tab; per-tab `<h1>` gives a landing target | PARTIAL | Tabpanel has no `aria-labelledby` back to the selected tab and there is no live-region policy. Rolled into the DSYNC-A11Y-2 punch-list entry. |
| AUDIT0827-UX-8 | AUDIT0827 | Medium | Accessibility | Calendar lacks grid semantics and full accessible dates | `app.js:2646-2683` `renderCalendarGrid()` emits bare `<button class="cal-cell">` with `aria-label` = day number + status; no `role="grid"`, no `aria-current`, no arrow keys | STILL_OPEN | `aria-label` improved (day + "יש נתונים"/"שיא אישי"), but the grid pattern the finding asked for is absent. |
| AUDIT0827-UX-9 | AUDIT0827 | Medium | Accessibility | Form errors lack persistent field-level descriptions | `cloud.js:4377-4385` `field()` splices `aria-invalid` + `aria-describedby`; `app.js:2058` sets `aria-invalid` on the WOD builder name and focuses it, with no `aria-describedby` | PARTIAL | Community forms route through `field()`; app.js core forms do not. |
| AUDIT0827-UX-10 | AUDIT0827 | Medium | Accessibility | Shared photos always use empty alt text | `cloud.js:9231` composer alt-text input (`ALT_TEXT_MAX`), `cloud.js:6211` renders `alt="${alt}"` with explicit decorative opt-out; but `cloud.js:11151` legacy card still `alt=""` | PARTIAL | The shipped `post_media` path is fixed; the legacy `photo_path` fallback card is not. |
| AUDIT0827-UX-11 | AUDIT0827 | Medium | Accessibility | SVG charts lack accessible name and data alternative | `app.js:2306-2314` — `role="img"` + a computed Hebrew trend summary (range, endpoints, PR count); `test/chart-accessible-name.test.mjs` | PARTIAL | Accessible name done (COMM-359). The adjacent data table/list the finding also asked for was not built. |
| AUDIT0827-UX-12 | AUDIT0827 | Medium | UX | Numeric inputs visually cleared on focus | Stepper uses `select()` instead of clearing; `test/stepper-tap-type.test.mjs` | VERIFIED_FIXED | |
| AUDIT0827-UX-13 | AUDIT0827 | Low | UX | Icon targets too small for mobile | `index.html:243` `.tabbtn{min-height:44px}`; calendar/icon targets raised | VERIFIED_FIXED | |
| AUDIT0827-UX-14 | AUDIT0827 | Low | UX | Community photo picker is an emoji with title text | Composer has a visible-text picker plus per-photo alt field (`cloud.js:9228-9231`) | VERIFIED_FIXED | |
| AUDIT0827-UX-15 | AUDIT0827 | Low | UX | Essential secondary text at 9–13 px | `index.html:263,281,284,291,292` — `.stat-label` 11 px, `.bar-caption` 11 px, `.stepper-label` 11 px, `.section-label` 12 px, `.empty` 13 px | STILL_OPEN | No rem token scale for body copy. |

| AUDIT0827-QA-3 | AUDIT0827 | High | QA | No automated two-user RLS suite | 77 files in `supabase/tests/`; `migration-check` job runs `supabase start` + `supabase test db` with no `continue-on-error` | PARTIAL | The suite is real, large and a hard gate. It has never been validated against the live project, and it creates no storage objects, so storage policies are still untested (`docs/community/backlog.md:160-164`). |
| AUDIT0827-QA-4 | AUDIT0827 | High | QA | No end-to-end community test against staging | `scripts/smoke-test-multi-role.mjs` exists, deliberately outside CI; first run 2026-09-22, against a LOCAL stack at 178 migrations (the same count `npm run check:drift` reports for production): 18/19 assertions passed, the one failure being the script's own `private_records?select=id` bug (that table is keyed `(user_id, record_type, record_id)` and has no `id` column, so PostgREST answered 400 before reaching any policy), fixed 2026-09-22. No staging project and no test accounts, so still nothing has run against a deployed project | STILL_OPEN | Same root cause as DSYNC-SEC-2 / COMM-338. A local run is not a staging run. |
| AUDIT0827-QA-5 | AUDIT0827 | Medium | QA | Accessibility automation absent | `test/tablist-keyboard.test.mjs`, `test/community-dialog-focus.test.mjs`, `test/heading-outline.test.mjs`, `test/chart-accessible-name.test.mjs`, `test/brass-contrast.test.mjs` exist; no axe dependency in `package.json`; no 320 px/200% reflow check | PARTIAL | Targeted a11y tests shipped; the scanner-based half did not. |
| AUDIT0827-QA-6 | AUDIT0827 | Medium | QA | Offline recovery needs fault injection | `test/storage-quota-exceeded.test.mjs` covers quota; nothing covers partial cache, IDB denial, corrupt records, clock skew, interrupted upgrades | STILL_OPEN | |

| AUDIT0827-OPS-H4 | AUDIT0827 | High | DevOps | Account purge not implemented as versioned infrastructure | `supabase/migrations/202609060011_close_launch_readiness_gap_findings.sql` schedules `cron.schedule('purge-due-accounts', '59 3 * * *', ...)` | VERIFIED_FIXED | This row's original evidence (202609050005 skipping the job) was accurate when written; 202609060011, one migration later, closed it. Re-verified 2026-09-10: confirmed live and active on the production project via a direct `cron.job` query. See CORRECTIONS_COMPLETED.md item 4. |
| AUDIT0827-OPS-M5 | AUDIT0827 | Medium | DevOps | Environment config hard-coded in a tracked file | `cloud-config.js:5-6` — production Supabase URL and publishable key committed; no template, no deploy-time generation, no staging marker | STILL_OPEN | Key is non-secret by design; the risk is target confusion, exactly as the rescan framed it. |
| AUDIT0827-OPS-M6 | AUDIT0827 | Medium | DevOps | Service worker accepts an incomplete app shell | `sw.js:24` `REQUIRED_ASSETS` / `:43` `OPTIONAL_ASSETS`; `:91` required assets fail install as one atomic group, `:93` optional assets tolerate failure | VERIFIED_FIXED | `sw.js:44` also has `./cloud.js` in OPTIONAL — closes DSYNC-PERF-1/COMM-330. |
| AUDIT0827-OPS-M7 | AUDIT0827 | Medium | DevOps | Supply-chain controls incomplete | `test.yml` pins all 3 actions by SHA; `scripts/check-vendored-supabase-version.mjs` compares version strings only; no SBOM, no license review, no scheduled online scan, no Dependabot | PARTIAL | Pinning done; SBOM/scan/checksum not. |
| AUDIT0827-OPS-M8 | AUDIT0827 | Medium | DevOps | Monitoring and health checks missing | `src/analytics.js` writes product events to `public.analytics_events` only; no error sink, no uptime/synthetic check, no purge/outbox metrics | STILL_OPEN | |

being re-adjudicated.

| ID | Source | Priority | Category | Finding | Current evidence | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RESCAN-H1 | RESCAN | High | Security | Anonymous sign-in has no identity recovery and weakens abuse controls | Anonymous auth replaced by username+password (`cloud.js:3770` `usernameToEmail()`), gated on `profiles.recovery_verified_at` (`cloud.js:862,872,940-943`), with an admin-triggered reset Edge Function (`supabase/functions/admin_reset_password/`, `cloud.js:3063`); throttle is actor-keyed (`202608280013_invite_actor_throttle.sql:24-48,62-81`) | VERIFIED_FIXED | Both halves — recoverable identity and an actor-level throttle surviving session replacement — are real. |

| RESCAN-M6 | RESCAN | Medium | Accessibility | Unlabelled fields and weak error linkage | `cloud.js:4377-4385` `field()` helper covers community forms; challenge/invite/comment fields route through it | PARTIAL | Same as AUDIT0827-UX-9. DSYNC-A11Y-8 notes a few coach/admin inputs still placeholder-only. |
| RESCAN-M7 | RESCAN | Medium | Accessibility | Community photos have no text alternative | See AUDIT0827-UX-10 | PARTIAL | |

| RESCAN-L4 | RESCAN | Low | Security | Photo quota is object-count based, no aggregate byte budget | 20-object quota from `202608270006`; no byte budget added since | STILL_OPEN | Partly mitigated: `src/image.js` re-encodes and downsizes client-side before upload. |

| DSYNC-DT-2 | DSYNC | P1 | Design | `--shadow-card` formula differs per app | Community's redesigned formula is intentional and shipped; `crossfit-pwa-Noam` never received the backport (`backlog.md:3382-3387`) | PARTIAL | COMM-351. Nothing to change in *this* repo — the residual work is in a repo outside this workspace. |

| DSYNC-DT-5 | DSYNC | P1 | Design | `--steel` value differs between repos | `index.html:99,135,148` — Community's AA-clearing values; Noam still pre-fix | PARTIAL | COMM-354, Noam-side only. |
| DSYNC-DT-6 | DSYNC | P1 | Design | `.icon-btn` removed; two header icon buttons use different treatments | `index.html:771,775` — both header buttons now use `class="icon-chip icon-chip-steel"` | VERIFIED_FIXED | COMM-345. |
| DSYNC-DT-7 | DSYNC | P2 | Design | `.save-btn` gradient vs. flat | Community keeps the `color-mix()` gradient by choice | NO_LONGER_APPLICABLE | Cross-repo style reconciliation; Community's treatment is the intended one. |

| DSYNC-SS-1 (P0 #15) | DSYNC | P0 | UX/IA | Bottom tab bar replaced by hamburger nav — needs an explicit decision | `index.html:845` bottom tablist + `index.html:767` desktop sidebar; `backlog.md:3799-3850` records the reversal and its reasoning | VERIFIED_FIXED | Decided twice, explicitly, with test coverage (`test/nav-community-bottom-tab.test.mjs`) and a real browser-check regression caught and fixed. |
| DSYNC-SS-2 (P0 #2) | DSYNC | P0 | Design | Settings screen never received the card-based redesign | Settings now renders card-based panes with the cloud-aware staleness banner at `app.js:3046` and legal links at `:3093` | VERIFIED_FIXED | COMM-323 + COMM-355. |
| DSYNC-SS-3 (P0 #3) | DSYNC | P0 | UX | WOD Builder regressed the create-button placement fix | WOD builder is registered on `APP_DIALOGS` (`app.js:3854`) and the pinned bottom-bar action is covered by `test/wod-save-button-pinned.test.mjs` | VERIFIED_FIXED | COMM-324. |

| DSYNC-SS-8 | DSYNC | P1 | Design | Header icon buttons use two different styles | See DSYNC-DT-6 | VERIFIED_FIXED | |
| DSYNC-SS-9 | DSYNC | P2 | Design | Achievements panel missing progress chips / capstone styling / `.ach-invite` | Achievements overlay is registered (`app.js:3855`) and styled; the specific chrome parity items were folded into the design-sync batch | VERIFIED_FIXED | Marked `done` under COMM-350's batch; no residual defect found in-repo. |
| DSYNC-SS-10 | DSYNC | P2 | Design | Settings staleness logic kept but lost `.settings-warn` visual treatment | `app.js:3046` uses `class="settings-warn" role="status"` with the ⚠️ icon | VERIFIED_FIXED | COMM-355. |

### New findings from this reconciliation

| ID | Source | Priority | Category | Finding | Current evidence | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| AUDIT-RECON-001 | this pass | P0 | Security | Anonymous-read confidentiality gap: three read policies were `to authenticated` with no membership predicate, so any visitor minting an anonymous JWT could read every profile, club/public post and announcement | `supabase/migrations/202609060001_anonymous_read_gate.sql:1-50` documents the hole and gates `profiles_read_authenticated`, `posts_feed_select` and `announcements_read` behind `is_community_member()`; `202609060009_definer_read_gate.sql` covers 5 SECURITY DEFINER functions; `supabase/tests/0067_anonymous_read_gate_test.sql` (225 lines) and `0075_definer_read_gate_test.sql` assert it | VERIFIED_FIXED | **Not present in any of the three prior audit documents** — found and closed by `d2e6408` after them. Recorded here because DSYNC-SEC-5 explicitly warned that the sampled RLS review might miss exactly this, and it did. Reinforces the case for the full policy-by-policy pass. |
| AUDIT-RECON-002 | this pass | P1 | Process | Ticket status bookkeeping has drifted far enough that the backlog cannot serve as a launch gate | ~60 `docs/community/tickets/COMM-*.md` files carry `Status: todo` while `backlog.md` records the same IDs as `review`/`done` (e.g. COMM-001..020 `todo` in file, `review` in table); COMM-120..125 are the reverse (`review` in file, `todo` in table); the whole Phase 1 table (`backlog.md:178-259`) is `todo` for shipped code | STILL_OPEN | Two independent status stores that disagree in both directions. Pick one as authoritative and make the other derived or deleted. |
| AUDIT-RECON-003 | this pass | P2 | Security | `image_url` columns carry a length-only CHECK, no URL-scheme check | `supabase/migrations/202608280010_events.sql:14` `image_url text check (... char_length <= 500)` — no `~* '^https?://'`, unlike `events.map_link` (`202609050004_event_map_link_scheme.sql:58-61`) and `profiles.avatar_url` (`202609060006`); rendered into `<img src>` at `cloud.js:6349,7291,8074,8507,11108` | STILL_OPEN | Low exploitability: writes are staff-gated, `esc()` prevents attribute escape, and CSP `img-src` (`index.html:41`) blocks off-origin loads. It is an unfinished-symmetry gap, not a live hole. Client-side validation exists for `mapLink` (`cloud.js:8160`) but not for `imageUrl`. |
| AUDIT-RECON-004 | this pass | P2 | Architecture | Inline-style count in `cloud.js` regressed despite COMM-347 being `done` | 780 `style="` occurrences in `cloud.js` today vs. 722 measured on 2026-09-02; `app.js` at 276 vs. 277 | STILL_OPEN | COMM-347's scope ("high-traffic classless components") was met; the file-level trend was not. Any future design-token sync still has to hunt strings. |
| AUDIT-RECON-005 | this pass | P2 | Legal | Legal documents have no recorded external sign-off | `backlog.md:3178-3183` — COMM-335's own closing note states sign-off "is still recorded outside this repo if the product owner ever forms a real legal entity" | PARTIAL | Correctly and honestly scoped out. Recorded so it is not mistaken for complete. |
| AUDIT-RECON-006 | this pass | P2 | Process | The four most recent remediation commits have no ticket IDs and no changelog entries | `60158de` ("14 launch-readiness findings"), `8742369`, `c39f640`, `d2e6408` ("every finding") are absent from `backlog.md`'s ticket tables (last section is "Community promoted to the bottom tab bar (2026-09-04)") and from `CHANGES.md` (last touched `9869543`) | STILL_OPEN | ~10 K lines of change across 10 migrations and 20+ test files with no traceable finding IDs. Directly weakens the next audit's ability to reconcile. Subsumes DSYNC-CONTENT-5. |
| AUDIT-RECON-007 | this pass | P2 | QA | Two of the three CI gates could not be re-verified in this pass | `migration-check` needs Docker; `browser-checks` needs a Playwright browser install. Only `npm test` was executed | STILL_OPEN | Not a defect in the code — a limitation of this audit. The pgTAP and browser-check pass claims in `d2e6408` remain the commit author's own, unreplicated. |

## Verification method notes

- Every "VERIFIED_FIXED" row above was confirmed by reading the current file at the cited
  line, not by trusting the source document or the closing commit message.
- Cross-repo rows (`crossfit-pwa-Noam`) are marked NO_LONGER_APPLICABLE or PARTIAL because
  that repository is outside this workspace and could not be inspected in this pass. Where
  the backlog records a verified cross-repo diff (COMM-351/353/354), that record was read
  but not independently re-derived.
- `npm test` was run once, cleanly, from the committed tree. `migration-check` and
  `browser-checks` were not run (see AUDIT-RECON-007).
- No application code, migration, test, or git state was modified by this audit.
