// Launch-readiness audit, RELIABILITY: the community write outbox.
//
// THE GAP THIS CLOSES. README.md has always advertised "an IndexedDB outbox
// retries writes after connectivity returns", and that was true - for
// private_records only, the offline training log's own sync channel
// (flushOutbox() in cloud.js). Not one community write went through it: a
// post, comment, cheer, RSVP or coach progress entry made with no
// connection simply failed, showed an error, and was gone. The member
// retyped it or lost it. That is the gap RELIABILITY_AUDIT.md recorded, and
// this file is the queue that closes it.
//
// WHY A SEPARATE QUEUE from the private_records one. They have genuinely
// different semantics and merging them would make both worse:
//   * private_records is a LAST-WRITE-WINS mirror of local state, keyed
//     (user, record_type, record_id). Re-sending it is free, order does not
//     matter, and a superseded row can be dropped.
//   * a community write is an EVENT. Sending it twice creates two posts,
//     order matters (a comment must not precede its post), and a permanent
//     failure has to be shown to the member rather than silently retried.
// So this queue is FIFO, attempt-counted, backed off, and surfaces its own
// failures; the private_records one stays exactly as it is.
//
// TRANSPORT-AGNOSTIC ON PURPOSE. This file never imports the Supabase
// client and never names an RPC. cloud.js registers one handler per action
// via registerHandler(); the queue only knows how to persist, order, retry
// and report. That is what makes it testable in jsdom with no network, and
// it is why the whole engine can be exercised without a backend.
//
// EVERY QUEUED OP CARRIES AN IDEMPOTENCY KEY, generated once at enqueue and
// persisted with the row. That key is what makes retry safe: the server
// side (202609060014) returns the original result for a repeated key
// instead of writing again. A key generated per ATTEMPT would defeat the
// entire mechanism, so it is written once, at enqueue, and never
// regenerated - including across a browser restart, because it lives in
// IndexedDB with the row.
(function () {
  "use strict";

  // Five attempts with exponential backoff: ~1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s. After
  // that the row is `failed` and waits for the member, rather than
  // retrying forever against something that is clearly not going to work.

  var MAX_DELAY_MS = 60000;

  // ---- SILENT ROWS -------------------------------------------------------
  //
  // A silent row is a measurement, not a member's action. Analytics is the
  // only caller (cloud.js registers the `analytics_event` handler), and it
  // arrives here because an offline event was being DROPPED outright - the
  // insert rejected, analyticsTrack() swallowed it, and the row was gone. A
  // member who trains in a basement with no signal was invisible in every
  // number this app computes.
  //
  // It rides this queue's persistence, ordering and reconnect drain, and
  // opts out of the three behaviours that exist for member WRITES and would
  // be wrong for telemetry:
  //
  //   1. IT NEVER BECOMES `failed`, so it never reaches the member-visible
  //      outbox surface. src/analytics.js's contract is that a failed
  //      analytics write is invisible and a dropped row is acceptable; a
  //      telemetry row sitting in a member's "these did not send" list with
  //      a Retry button next to it would be a bug in both directions.
  //      A silent row that exhausts its attempts, or hits a permanent
  //      error, is deleted.
  //   2. IT NEVER STOPS THE DRAIN. The FIFO stop-on-first-not-ready rule
  //      exists so a comment cannot land before its post. Analytics has no
  //      such causal chain, and a backed-off telemetry row that held up a
  //      real post would turn a measurement into an outage.
  //   3. IT IS CAPPED. post_impression fires once per card per feed
  //      session, so browsing a cached feed offline can mint rows by the
  //      hundred. Oldest-first trimming keeps the queue bounded, which is
  //      the same trade fitProps() already makes for oversized props:
  //      losing some telemetry beats an unbounded IndexedDB queue on
  //      somebody's phone.
  var SILENT_MAX = 200;

  // Errors that will never succeed on retry, so the row goes straight to
  // `failed` without burning five attempts and ~30 seconds first. Matched
