// src/shared/safe-helpers.js in COMM-368 - they are the generic, low-level
// half of this file and the half the sibling Box Log client had a
// byte-identical fork of. They are bound as bare identifiers at the top of
// src/constants.js, which loads before this file, so every call site below
// (and in app.js) is unchanged.
//
// What stays here is the half that is NOT shareable: the per-record
// sanitizers, which are specific to this app's own schema (entries, WODs,
// bodyweight, measurements) and to this repo's LIMITS/MOVEMENT_CATEGORIES.
// ---------- Record sanitizers ----------
// Applied to every record that comes off disk or out of an imported file.
// Nothing else in the app is allowed to trust these shapes.

// WOD published to the whole box, so that a weekly-challenge comparison_key
// of the form wod:<id>:<scoreType>:<rx|scaled> resolves on EVERY device
// rather than only the author's — see allWods() in app.js.
//
// `category` is a render-time constant on both sides (it is not stored in
// club_wods either) and only these two values exist, because two call sites
// elsewhere are written as identity checks against it and would silently
// change meaning for any third value: app.js deleteCustomWod() requires
// "Custom" (so a member cannot delete the club's programming off their own
// device), and cloud.js challengeKeyChoices() skips "Custom" (so a club WOD,
// unlike a private one, is offerable as a challenge).
//
// THE CATEGORY IS NEVER READ OFF THE INPUT. It is decided by WHICH FUNCTION
// YOU CALL, and that is a security boundary rather than a style choice.
// sanitizeCustomWod() always produces "Custom"; only sanitizeClubWod() —
// reached solely from app.js setClubWods()/loadCachedClubWods(), i.e. only
// from club_wods_list() or the cache written from it — produces "Club".
//
// An earlier draft trusted `w.category`, and that was exploitable. The same
// sanitizer runs on private_records restores (app.js, record_type
// "custom_wod") and on imported backup files, so a member could hand-write
// `category: "Club"` into a backup, import it, and mint a pseudo-club WOD on
// their own device: undeletable, because deleteCustomWod() refuses anything
// that is not "Custom", and offered as a weekly-challenge key, because
// challengeKeyChoices() skips only "Custom". Two identity checks that each
// read correctly in isolation combine into a privilege the member does not
// have. Deciding by call site removes the input's vote entirely.
