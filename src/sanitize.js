// cleanStr/cleanNum/cleanId/cleanISODate/cleanTs and uid moved to
// src/shared/safe-helpers.js in COMM-368 - they are the generic, low-level
// half of this file and the half the sibling Box Log client had a
// byte-identical fork of. They are bound as bare identifiers at the top of
// src/constants.js, which loads before this file, so every call site below
// (and in app.js) is unchanged.
//
// What stays here is the half that is NOT shareable: the per-record
// sanitizers, which are specific to this app's own schema (entries, WODs,
// bodyweight, measurements) and to this repo's LIMITS/MOVEMENT_CATEGORIES.
// ---------- Record sanitizers ----------
// Applied to every record that comes off disk or out of an imported file.
// Nothing else in the app is allowed to trust these shapes.
