//
// One place that writes public.analytics_events (migration
// 202608280012). Every tracked product action goes through
// analyticsTrack(), so the event names stay an allow-list in one file
// instead of drifting into free-text strings at each call site.
//
// The table takes a direct RLS insert, not an RPC: the insert policy is
// own-row or a null user_id, and reads are gated on
// community.analytics.view, so a member cannot read back what they wrote.
//
// Phase 0 ships the helper, the constants, and the bus bridge. COMM-170
// in Phase 1 calls configure() from cloud.js and wires the surfaces.
// COMM-233 in Phase 2 wires the surfaces that shipped after it, adds the
// four names those needed, and adds HAND_PROP_KEYS - the same allow-list
// discipline the bus bridge had, for the events that are tracked by hand.
//
// Every tracked event, its trigger surface, its props, and the Weekly
// Community Active Members definition: docs/community/metrics.md.
//

// does not move SCHEMA_VERSION. Removing or renaming a prop, or changing
// what an existing prop means, bumps it, so a query can tell the two

  //
  // COMM-233 reviewed every Phase 2 name against the definition rather than
  // letting a new event default into or out of the set:
  // - challenge_joined, challenge_completed and event_rsvp were already
  //   qualifying activity types under the spec 78 definition, and now have
  //   real producers. No change.
  // - coach_congratulate_sent counts, for the coach who sent it. The row's
  //   user_id is the actor, so the celebrated member is never made active
  //   by somebody else's action - the comment or post it writes reaches
  //   them through post_created / comment_created on their own behalf when
  //   they answer it.
  // - weekly_recap_shared counts, on the same reading as achievement_shared
  //   already in this list: a share is a post the member published.
  // - leaderboard_viewed, weekly_recap_opened, search_performed and
  //   directory_opened do not. Viewing is not the bar the definition sets
  //   (posting, commenting, reacting, joining, attending, or opening a
  //   community item somebody else made); a roster and a search box are
  //   navigation, not participation.
  // - push_opt_in does not. Changing a notification setting is account
  //   configuration, not community activity.
  //
  // COMM-300 adds attendance_recorded, and it counts. "Attending" is named
  // outright in the spec 78 definition this list implements, and training is
  // the strongest participation the club has: a member who showed up and
  // trained is active for that week whether or not they posted about it.
  // This is the one qualifying activity WCAM has been missing since Phase 0,
  // and the only one on this list that can be true for a member who never
  // opened the Community tab.
  //
  // COMM-307 adds classmates_card_viewed and it does NOT count, on exactly
  // the reasoning leaderboard_viewed already uses: viewing is not the bar the
  // definition sets. The card appearing is not something the member did - it
  // is something their training and somebody else's happened to make true -
  // and the training that produced it is already counted, once, as
  // attendance_recorded. Counting the card too would count one member's
  // session twice and would also make a member active for a week on the
  // strength of another member's session. A follow or a profile open from the
  // card counts, through member_followed and profile_opened, because those
  // are the member acting.
  //
  // The eleven-module pass reviewed each of its own new names the same way,
  // one at a time, and added exactly two:
  // - welcome_sent counts. welcomeNewMember() writes a real comment through
  //   add_post_comment, and "created a comment" is the definition's own first
  //   bullet. It bypasses the composer, so no COMMENT_CREATED bus event is
  //   emitted for it - this is a gap in the existing count being closed, not
  //   a new kind of activity being admitted.
  // - member_of_week_published counts, FOR THE PUBLISHING COACH, on exactly
  //   coach_congratulate_sent's reasoning: the row's user_id is the actor,
  //   and recognising a member in front of the club is the same act of
  //   community participation from the same side of it. The recognised
  //   member is never made active by somebody else's action.
  // Everything else the pass added does not count, and each for a stated
  // reason rather than by default:
  // - announcement_viewed, monthly_recap_viewed and new_member_post_viewed
  //   are views, and viewing is not the bar the definition sets - the same
  //   call leaderboard_viewed and classmates_card_viewed already made. NOTE
  //   that the WCAM
  //   definition's "opened an announcement" clause still has no producer:
  //   announcements are rendered inline in an archive and in a feed card,
  //   never opened, so there is no open to record. Recorded here so the
  //   clause is not mistaken for something this event implements.
  // - club_wod_result_attached does not. The member is already counted for
  //   the day they trained, through attendance_recorded, and attaching a
  //   result they already logged is the same session reaching a second
  //   surface, not a second act.
  // - post_photo_attached and mention_inserted do not. Both happen INSIDE a
  //   composer, before anything is published; the publish itself is
  //   post_created / comment_created and already counts. An abandoned draft
  //   must never make anyone active.
  // - outward_share_completed does not. It is a share to somewhere that is
  //   not this club - the same distinction the module map already draws
  //   between workout_shared and outward_share.
  // - streak_nudge_opened does not, because notification_opened fires on the
  //   same tap and already counts that member once.
  // - engagement_flag_actioned does not. It is staff triage of a queue, the
  //   administrative half of coach_tools rather than a community act, and the
  //   coach becomes active through the pfanie they then send.
  // - app_opened, push_permission and push_self_test do not. Opening the app
  //   is not participation, and a permission or a device test is account
  //   configuration - push_opt_in's own reasoning, unchanged.
