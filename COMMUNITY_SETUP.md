# Community backend setup

The app remains fully usable offline when the backend is not configured.

## Create the backend

1. Create separate Supabase projects for staging and production.
2. Run every file in `supabase/migrations/`, in filename order (currently
   `202608260001_community_foundation.sql`, then
   `202608270001_community_growth.sql`, then
   `202608270002_lock_anon_defaults.sql`, then
   `202608270003_invite_gate.sql`, then
   `202608270004_community_engagement.sql`, then
   `202608270005_coach_tier.sql`, then
   `202608270006_security_hardening.sql`, then
   `202608270007_grant_coach_by_handle.sql`, then
   `202608270008_hebrew_handles.sql`, then
   `202608270009_admin_moderation_visibility.sql`, then
   `202608270010_rate_limiting.sql`, then
   `202608270011_admin_member_management.sql`), in each project.
   `202608270001` adds the reactions RLS fix, achievement-unlock posts,
   coach announcements, activity streaks, and the weekly challenge — none
   of those features work until it's applied. `202608270002` is a
   required follow-up, not optional: this project auto-grants the `anon`
   role SELECT on any table created afterward unless a migration revokes
   it again, and `202608270001` didn't for its own new tables — without
   `202608270002`, `activity_pings`, `announcements`, `weekly_challenges`,
   and `community_streaks` are all readable with no login at all. Any
   *future* migration that adds a table should double check this the same
   way (query it as anon, no session, right after applying) rather than
   assuming the default-privilege revoke below still covers it forever —
   it only covers tables created after the point it runs. `202608270003`
   gates community sign-up behind an invite code — **after running it, no
   one can create a community profile until you insert at least one
   active code**:
   ```sql
   -- Historical example only. Do not run after 202608270006.
   ```
   Migration `202608270006` supersedes the original code-creation and
   coach-redemption instructions below. Follow "Hardened invite and photo
   operations" after applying the complete migration set.
   `role` is `'member'` or `'coach'` — as of `202608270005`, a `'coach'`
   code grants a fixed set of powers on its own (see "Access tiers"
   below), no separate step needed. To make someone a full admin, that's
   still a separate manual step, unrelated to invite codes. Sign-in has
   no email (see below), so look them up by handle, not email:
   ```sql
   update public.profiles set is_admin = true where handle = 'their-handle';
   ```
   (only works after they've signed in once, redeemed a code, and saved
   a profile — the profile row, and its handle, has to exist first).

   `202608270004` fixes a real bug in `202608270003`: the trigger meant to
   stop a client-side path from ever setting `is_admin` also blocked a
   *legitimate* manual grant run directly in the SQL editor — the exact
   `update ... set is_admin = true` command above would silently do
   nothing. If you ran that command before this migration and it didn't
   stick, re-run it after applying `202608270004`. This migration also
   adds: comments on posts, a `post-photos` Storage bucket (private,
   5MB/image limit) for optional photos on a shared result, a
   `coach_new_members()` RPC mirroring `coach_inactive_members()`, and a
   `pinned_date` column on `announcements` for a daily WOD note.

   `202608270005` builds the coach tier (see "Access tiers" below) — a
   coach-code redemption (`insert into public.invite_codes (code, role)
   values ('COACHCODE2026', 'coach');`) was the historical flow. Migration
   `202608270006` disables public coach-code promotion and replaces it with
   a trusted service-role promotion step. A coach then receives:
   posting/pinning announcements, setting the weekly challenge, and
   seeing the new/inactive member views, without needing the manual
   `is_admin` grant.
3. In Authentication → Sign In / Providers:
   - Enable **Anonymous Sign-ins** (off by default) — still required, as
     the one-time bootstrap step a brand-new signup uses before it has
     real credentials. See "Sign-in has no email" below.
   - Under the **Email** provider, turn **Confirm email** OFF. The app
     never configures SMTP and never will (see below) — every account's
     email field is a synthetic, never-delivered address, so a
     confirmation requirement would either silently fail to send or lock
     every new signup out of their own just-created account.
4. Copy the project URL and **publishable** key into `cloud-config.js`.
5. Never place a secret or service-role key in browser code, Git, or a static-host environment variable.
6. Schedule `select public.purge_due_accounts();` once daily from a trusted service-role Edge Function or external scheduler.

## Sign-in has no email, but does have a real username + password

Two-step signup, both in-app forms with no redirect anywhere: a
brand-new member first redeems a club invite code (needs some session to
attach the redemption to, so `ensureAnonymousSession()` silently creates
a throwaway anonymous one — a real `auth.users` row, `auth.uid()` works
normally, RLS applies exactly as for any other `authenticated` session).
Right after redeeming, they set a username + password, which
`client.auth.updateUser({ email, password })` links to that *same*
`auth.uid()` — the anonymous session becomes a permanent one in place,
no data migration, no new row. A returning member on any device just
calls `client.auth.signInWithPassword(...)` with those same credentials
and lands back in the exact same account.

The "email" `updateUser`/`signInWithPassword` sees is never real and
never collected from the person: `cloud.js`'s `usernameToEmail()` builds
it locally as `${username}@members.haimuniya.invalid` purely because
Supabase's password provider requires an email-shaped identifier.
`.invalid` is the RFC 2606-reserved TLD for exactly this — guaranteed to
never resolve or receive anything. This is also why **Confirm email**
must stay off (see setup step 3): there is no inbox behind that address,
so a confirmation requirement would only ever lock people out.

This whole design exists to route around a real problem the previous
plain-anonymous-only version had: with no way to reauthenticate, a
cleared browser, a new device, or a reinstall left someone locked out of
their own profile/history/streak with no path back, and a casual-looking
"sign out" button would have been actively misleading, so there wasn't
one. Real credentials fix that directly — the Account tab can now offer
an honest sign-out, and logging in from a different device reaches the
same account. "Request account deletion" still exists for someone who
deliberately wants to walk away for good.

Because no real email is ever collected or sent, keep SMTP/email
delivery configuration entirely out of scope for this project going
forward — there is nothing in the app that would ever send a member an
email.

## Hardened invite and photo operations

Migration `202608270006_security_hardening.sql` revokes every legacy
plaintext invite. Create a replacement member code through the service role:

```sql
select public.create_member_invite(now() + interval '14 days', 1);
```

The returned high-entropy code is shown once and stored only as a hash. The
first argument is the expiry. The second is the maximum redemption count.
Normal redemption only grants member access.

Promote an existing redeemed member to coach through a trusted service-role
process — by handle (what you'd actually have on hand day to day):

```sql
select public.grant_coach_role_by_handle('their-handle');
```

Or by UUID directly, if you already have it:

```sql
select public.grant_coach_role('USER_UUID');
```

There is deliberately no code-based or client-reachable path to either
coach or admin — both are always a manual step run here, by an operator
with dashboard access. To make someone a full admin, still the same
handle-based `update` as before (not a function — deliberately not one,
to keep this the single rarest, most manual operation in the system):

```sql
update public.profiles set is_admin = true where handle = 'their-handle';
```

Run a daily service-role cleanup job which calls
`public.list_orphaned_post_photos(interval '1 day')`, then deletes the
returned objects through the Supabase Storage API. Do not delete Storage
objects through SQL because it only removes metadata.

## Required launch checks

- Run `npm test`.
- Run `npm run smoke-test-anon-key` against the real project - queries
  every table/view as the public anon key with no session and asserts
  each one returns nothing. The committed publishable key is only safe
  to ship if this stays true, and RLS has already been wrong on first
  attempt three separate times in this project's history. Not part of
  `npm test` since it needs the live network, unlike the rest of the
  suite.
- Optionally run `npm run setup-hooks` once per clone to catch
  APP_VERSION/SW_VERSION drift and a stale `vendor/supabase.js` before
  they're committed, not just in CI.
- Confirm Anonymous Sign-ins is enabled in the project (Authentication →
  Sign In / Providers) — without it, opening the Community tab fails
  silently at `signInAnonymously()` and nobody can ever get past
  "מתחברים לקהילה…".
- Running the migrations against an empty database is now automated: the
  `migration-check` job in `.github/workflows/test.yml` applies every
  file in `supabase/migrations/` from scratch on every PR, and on a push
  to `main`, via the Supabase CLI's local stack. Still worth doing once by
  hand against the real staging project before a release, since CI only
  proves the SQL applies cleanly, not that staging's existing data/config
  doesn't conflict with it.
- Test every RLS policy as two different users, especially private records, blocks, follower-only posts, and reports.
- Confirm bodyweight, measurements, session notes, WOD notes, and partner tags never appear in `workout_posts` or `community_feed`.
- Confirm a reported post disappears for its reporter.
- Confirm one user cannot attach or read another user's photo path.
- Confirm an unredeemed Auth user cannot upload a post photo.
- Confirm invite redemption stops after five failed attempts in 15 minutes.
- Confirm normal invite redemption never grants coach access.
- Confirm only an admin can run `review_report()`.
- Confirm blocking works in both directions.
- Confirm account deletion immediately unpublishes posts and the scheduled purge removes the Auth user after 30 days.
- Install Playwright Chromium and run the browser checks before deployment.
- Confirm posting a comment/reaction/report more than the configured
  rate limit returns `rate_limited` instead of silently queuing forever.

## CAPTCHA on sign-up — app side done, dashboard step required

**Status: the repository half is implemented and tested; the dashboard
half is a one-time step only the project owner can perform.** Until that
step is done the feature is OFF and completely inert — `captchaSiteKey`
ships as `""`, `captchaEnabled()` is false, and every auth call behaves
exactly as it did before the feature existed. Nothing breaks by leaving
it off; nothing is protected either.

Why it matters (launch-readiness audit, SEC-004): `signInAnonymously()`
is how *every* signup bootstraps, so creating an identity costs an
attacker nothing. Rate limiting only bounds what one account can do, not
how many accounts exist. Unlimited free identities are the raw material
for feed scraping, telemetry/storage flooding, and invite-code guessing
in parallel.

### What is already in the repo

- `cloud.js` gates all three auth entry points — `signInAnonymously()`,
  `signInWithPassword()` and `updateUser()` — through `withCaptcha()`,
  which obtains a single-use token and attaches it as `captchaToken`.
- Failure is **closed, never open**: a script that will not load, a
  provider error, an expired token or a 20-second timeout all refuse the
  request rather than quietly proceeding without a token. A failed
  challenge is retryable (the anonymous one-shot guard is released) and
  at login it reports "אימות האבטחה נכשל" rather than "wrong password".
- `index.html`'s CSP already allows exactly the two provider hosts, in
  `script-src`/`frame-src`, plus their verification endpoints in
  `connect-src`. Nothing else was widened.
- `test/community-captcha.test.mjs` pins all of the above.

### The dashboard step (project owner)

1. Create a site at **Cloudflare Turnstile** (or hCaptcha) and copy the
   **site key** (public) and **secret key** (private).
2. In Supabase: **Authentication → Bot and Abuse Protection** → enable
   CAPTCHA, choose the matching provider, paste the **secret key**.
   The secret key goes here and **nowhere in this repository**.
3. In `cloud-config.js`, set `captchaProvider` to `"turnstile"` or
   `"hcaptcha"` to match, and paste the **site key** into
   `captchaSiteKey`. A site key is public by design — same category as
   `supabasePublishableKey` right above it.
4. Deploy.

No environment variables are needed on the app side (this is a
build-free static site; `cloud-config.js` *is* the configuration). The
only secret involved lives in the Supabase dashboard.

### Verifying it actually works

After deploying with a site key set:

- Open the app in a private window and start a signup. The Turnstile /
  hCaptcha widget runs invisibly; sign-in should complete normally.
- In Supabase → Authentication → Logs, a signup attempt with a missing
  or invalid token is rejected server-side. That server-side rejection —
  not the widget appearing — is the actual control: the dashboard secret
  is what verifies the token, so an attacker calling the REST endpoint
  directly with no token is refused regardless of the browser.
- To confirm fail-closed behaviour, block `challenges.cloudflare.com` in
  devtools and try to sign in: the attempt must be refused with
  "אימות האבטחה נכשל, נסו שוב", never succeed.

## Access tiers

Three real tiers, as of `202608270005`:

- **Admin** (`profiles.is_admin = true`, manual dashboard-only grant) —
  everything, including who else is admin. Still the only tier that can
  ever be granted this way; there is no client-side path to it, coach
  code or otherwise.
- **Coach** (`invite_redemptions.role = 'coach'`) — a fixed set of
  powers, the same for every coach: post/pin announcements, set the
  weekly challenge, see the new/inactive member views. Set either at
  sign-up (which invite code they used) or afterward by an admin, from
  the Account tab's member-management panel (`202608270011`) or the
  `grant_coach_role_by_handle()` RPC (`202608270007`, service-role only).
  Deliberately *not* scoped to "their own" classes or members — Arbox
  already owns class scheduling and rosters, so this app's coach tier
  only needs to cover the community-layer actions above, not a parallel
  membership model.
- **Member** — the default: feed, sharing, comments, streaks.

Both admin and coach are checked server-side through a single
`public.is_staff()` function (true if either applies) — RLS policies and
the `coach_inactive_members()`/`coach_new_members()` functions all use
it, so there's one place that defines "staff," not two policies that can
drift apart.

## Managing members

The Account tab's "ניהול חברים" panel (admin-only, `202608270011`) is
the day-to-day way to look someone up — by handle, display name, or a
pasted user id — and grant/revoke coach or remove them, without the SQL
editor. `admin_grant_coach()`/`admin_revoke_coach()`/`admin_remove_member()`
all check real `is_admin` server-side, same boundary as `review_report()`.

For anything that panel doesn't cover, `public.admin_user_directory` is
a plain view (id, handle, display name, the synthetic login email, role,
`is_admin`, join date) meant to be queried directly in the Supabase SQL
editor or browsed in the Table Editor — it has no grants to `anon` or
`authenticated`, so it's only ever reachable with full project-owner
access, never from the app itself.

## Offline synchronization

Local writes are authoritative while offline and enter IndexedDB's `syncOutbox`. Once authenticated and online, the outbox upserts them into owner-only `private_records`.

Getting a session and getting `syncEnabled` turned on no longer requires the Community tab at all. `maybeAutoStartBackup()` (cloud.js, fired off `queueSyncRecord`'s `haimunia-sync-needed` event) creates a backup-only anonymous session the first time a member saves anything, purely to survive iOS Safari's ~7-day IndexedDB eviction for anyone who never opens Community — see PRIVACY.md and window.renderBackupSettingsPanel's Settings > "הגנה על הנתונים שלי" panel. `enableSyncIfAllowed()` flips `syncEnabled` on the moment any session exists (this path, or the ordinary Community sign-up path), unless the member explicitly opted out (`haimunia-demo:backupOptOut`). This is forward-only: it never touches anything already sitting unsynced in IndexedDB before the session existed.

Existing history predating a session is still queued only after the user explicitly approves it — the "סנכרון היסטוריה פרטית" ("sync private history") action in the Community tab's Account screen, unchanged from before, still the only path that calls `queueAllLocalRecordsForSync()`.

RLS-wise, `private_records` requires nothing but `user_id = auth.uid()` under role `authenticated` — no profile row, no invite redemption. Community membership (`is_community_member()`, gating the feed/posts/etc.) is a separate, unrelated requirement layered on `profiles` + `invite_redemptions`; a backup-only session never touches either.

The first release uses last-write-wins timestamps. A future multi-device conflict screen should be added before supporting collaborative editing of the same workout record.
