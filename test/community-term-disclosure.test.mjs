// Design spec section 3 — JARGON DISCLOSURE.
//
// Research 1.4: unexplained jargon is the #1 documented way fitness apps fail
// beginners; only 13 of 50 analysed apps avoid it, and AMRAP is one of three
// named canonical failures. The beginner persona documented 43 unexplained
// terms in this app, which passed at 2 of ~45 opportunities.
//
// THE DIAGNOSIS THAT MADE THIS CHEAP: the app had already written the fix and
// hidden it. Four perfect plain-Hebrew glosses ("AMRAP" -> "כמה סיבובים
// הספקתם") have lived in #wodBuilderOverlay since COMM-324, behind a comment
// saying they were written once, lost, and deliberately reinstated - shipped
// at 9.5px, the smallest type in the app, explaining the hardest words in the
// app, behind an overlay with no reachable opener. Their sizing has since
// been fixed on the shared .term-sub rule; this file is the rest of it.
//
// Three tiers: a permanent inline gloss where a term labels a control, a `?`
// marker where a term appears in content, and a bottom sheet that never
// blocks. Plus the thing that keeps it from becoming noise for an expert: the
// markers retire themselves.
