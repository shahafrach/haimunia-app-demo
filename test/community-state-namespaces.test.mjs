// COMM-365. cloud.js's `state` used to be ~139 flat sibling keys where the
// only thing stopping two feature clusters from colliding on a name like
// `view`, `items`, `loading` or `error` was a hand-maintained prefix
// convention (feedScope / challengeView / coachCelebrate / modQueueStatus).
// It is now namespaced by feature domain.
//
// This file is the guard that keeps it that way, and - more usefully - the
// guard that a namespaced path is never MIS-typed. A flat `state.foo` that no
// longer exists throws the moment it is read; a `state.feed.scop` typo reads
// undefined forever and silently renders the wrong thing. So the load-bearing
// assertion here is the third one: every two-level `state.<ns>.<leaf>`
// reference anywhere in cloud.js must name a leaf the literal declares.

  // 14 since the five-persona audit's outward-sharing work added

  //
  //   WHY A DIALOG AND NOT A REUSE. The three candidates were askConfirm
  //   (title + message + confirm + cancel), the PR prompt and the achievement
  //   celebration. None of them fits. The outward sheet has to show a canvas
  //   PREVIEW of the exact image about to leave the device, a name switch
  //   that repaints that image, and four independent exits - share, copy
  //   text, download the PNG, close - because which of them is available
  //   depends on what the browser actually supports (navigator.canShare with
  //   files, navigator.share, navigator.clipboard, none of the above).
  //   Bolting that onto askConfirm would have made askConfirm a general
  //   dialog framework, which is the thing this pin exists to prevent.
  //
  //   WHY IT IS SECOND IN THE REGISTRY. It is opened FROM the PR prompt and
  //   the achievement celebration and renders stacked over them, so - exactly
  //   like confirmSheet above it - it must be matched before the dialog
  //   underneath or the Tab trap and Escape address the covered one.
  //
  // 15 since design spec section 3 (jargon disclosure) added "termSheet", the
  // bottom sheet behind every `?` marker. Treated as the review trigger this
  // pin is meant to be — the full reasoning (why a new dialog rather than
  // askConfirm, why it sits third, and why the glossary is a second PAGE of
  // this sheet rather than a sixteenth entry) is written out beside the
  // matching key-order pin in community-destructive-symmetry.test.mjs, so the
  // two pins do not drift into two different half-explanations.
  //
  // The one thing worth repeating HERE, because it is this file's own
  // assertion: state.ui.termSheet must default to null like every other
  // dialog flag. It holds a glossary entry id while open, and `null` - not
  // "" - is what the loop below checks, so a dialog genuinely starts closed.
  // 16 since 202609080002 added "clubWodBoard", the club WOD board, in LAST
  // position. The full reasoning - why a dialog rather than a reuse of the
  // challenge/event overlay or a sixth sub-tab, and why last is the only
  // safe slot for it - is written out beside the matching key-order pin in
  // community-destructive-symmetry.test.mjs, so the two pins do not drift
  // into two different half-explanations.
  //
  // The half that is THIS file's own assertion: state.club.wodBoardView must
  // default to null like every other dialog flag. It holds
  // { sessionId, board, loading, error, busy, errorText } while open, and the
  // loop below checks for `null` exactly - so a dialog genuinely starts
  // closed. It also lives inside the existing `club` namespace rather than in
