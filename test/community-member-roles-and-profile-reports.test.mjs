// Launch-readiness audit, TESTING_GAPS.md TEST-2 / TEST-3.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The code-quality pass found three P1 client bugs,
// and all three were in the only two client surfaces with ZERO test
// coverage of any kind:
//
//   * member_roles      -> CQ-003 (the coach-badge cache poisoned by one
//                          transient RPC error, for the rest of the session)
//   * report_profile_target -> CQ-001 (a reported PROFILE labelled "פוסט"
//                          in two admin screens) and CQ-002 (a "remove
//                          content" button the server always rejects)
//
// That is not a coincidence worth leaving in place. These are the
// regression tests for the fixes, written against the shipped source so a
// future edit that reintroduces any of the three fails here.
