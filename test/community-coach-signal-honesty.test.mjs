// Coach signal honesty (202609060020).
//
// THE DEFECT. Measured live against a seeded, visibly active club - 41
// posts, reactions, comments, several members posting - the coach dashboard
// reported 8 of 8 members as never active, including the coach who had
// posted moments earlier, while the new-member list returned 4 of 12
// members who had all joined that same day.
//
// One input behind both: `activity_pings`, whose only writer anywhere in
// the system is pingActivity() in cloud.js - today only, from a live
// browser session. No trigger, no backfill, no server-side producer.
// 202609060002 states what a row in it means: "one row per day the member
// OPENED THE APP". Both functions were built on it and both were presented
// to coaches in training language.
//
// These assertions are the migration-contract half. The behavioural half
// runs for real against Postgres in
// supabase/tests/0083_coach_signal_honesty_test.sql, which exercises the
// actual RLS and the actual rows; a JS mock has no policy engine and could
// not tell the two apart.
