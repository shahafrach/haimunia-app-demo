// Security hunt, round 1 (2026-09-11): authorization/RLS boundary testing,
// XSS/injection surface, and sensitive-data exposure. Three fresh agents
// found no new authorization/RLS gaps (this codebase already went through
// five prior hardening passes, re-verified live against real local
// Postgres) and no exploitable XSS, but did confirm one real, low-severity
// information-disclosure bug and flag two defense-in-depth hardening
// opportunities worth closing even though neither is currently
// exploitable on its own. See CHANGES.md for the full report.
