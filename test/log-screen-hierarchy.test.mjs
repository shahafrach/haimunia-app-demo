// The log screen's visual hierarchy.
//
// WHAT WAS WRONG. The first screen a member ever sees rendered as a striped
// accent bar, two flat cards that read as identical list items, two unstyled
// sentences floating in space, and then roughly 60% empty screen above the
// nav. Nothing on it looked like the primary action - and the primary action
// of the entire app is on it: `מה עשינו היום? / בחירת תרגיל`, without which
// no other control on the screen even renders.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE PINS, and deliberately not more. The visual craft itself
// (the tint, the striped spine, the dashed frame) is judged by eye against
// screenshots in both themes; a test that asserted a hex value would just be
// a second copy of the stylesheet. What is worth mechanically pinning is the
// three RULES that make the screen work, each of which is a one-line edit
// away from silently regressing:
//
//   1. Exactly one primary at a time. The picker is styled as the primary
//      only while nothing is chosen; once an exercise IS chosen the orange
//      save button at the bottom is the primary, and two energy-coloured
//      blocks competing for "press me" is worse than none.
//   2. The empty state is the app's four-slot pattern (d540a34), not a
//      sentence. Same shape as cloud.js's emptyStateHtml() so the member's
//      log screen and the coach dashboard read as one product.
//   3. The tour offer stays reachable, stays a 64px target and stays below
//      the picker - what changed is only how loud it is.
