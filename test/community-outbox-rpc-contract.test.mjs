// Launch-readiness audit, follow-up. THE REGRESSION GUARD FOR A BUG THIS
// AUDIT ITSELF SHIPPED AND ALMOST DEPLOYED.
//
// WHAT HAPPENED. communityRpc() attaches a p_idempotency_key to every action
// in OUTBOX_ACTIONS. 202609060014 added that parameter to four of the five
// SQL functions and missed event_rsvp, so every RSVP became:
//
//   PGRST202 "Could not find the function
//             public.event_rsvp(p_event_id, p_idempotency_key, p_response)"
//
// PostgREST resolves overloads by the EXACT set of named arguments - an
// extra one is not ignored, it fails to resolve. RSVP would have been
// completely dead on deploy.
//
// WHY ALL THREE SUITES WERE GREEN ON IT. pgTAP calls the functions directly
// in SQL, where the client's extra argument does not exist. The browser
// scenario goes through mockCloud.mjs, whose rpc() stand-in accepts any
// argument shape. The node tests assert source text. Nothing crossed the
// client's call shape against the server's real signature - which is the
// seam this file now covers.
//
// It was found by curling the real PostgREST endpoint. This test is the
// cheap, always-on version of that check.
