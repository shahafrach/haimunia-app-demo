// Three findings carried on the open list across two branches, all in cloud.js.
//
//  1. A restricted member had no way to find out why, or for how long. The
//     only channel telling them anything was an error on a failed write.
//     RLS already granted them SELECT on their own posting_restrictions row
//     (202608280015) - the data was there and nothing rendered it.
//  2. The four <input type="datetime-local"> controls had the same
//     browser-locale defect the six type="date" controls were fixed for in
//     d540a34, and were deliberately left because a datetime echo raises a
//     timezone question a date-only echo does not.
//  3. Two coach-dashboard empty states the four-slot pass missed.
//
// Driven through the real render path (bootCommunity + the mock Supabase
// client) wherever the finding is about what a person SEES; source-text
// assertions only for invariants about the shape of the code itself.
//
// THE RLS HALF OF FINDING 1 IS NOT MOCKABLE and was verified against the
// real local stack rather than asserted here. Signed in over REST as two
// seeded members restricted through the real mod_restrict_member() RPC:
//
//   maya_t (temporary, reason recorded) reads back her own row with every
//     field this panel renders - restriction_type, expires_at, reason,
//     created_at, lifted_at.
//   itai_r (permanent, no reason) reads back expires_at: null and
//     reason: "" - the two edge cases the panel's copy forks on, arriving
//     from the database exactly as the schema's defaults promise.
//   noa_s (unrestricted) reads back [].
//   maya_t selecting the whole table gets ONE row, her own - the select
//     policy's `user_id = auth.uid()` branch holds, so this panel cannot
//     become an "is member X in trouble" oracle.
//   maya_t's post_create refuses with 'posting_restricted' while feed_page
//     still returns rows - so the panel's "you can still read the feed"
//     line is a promise the app keeps.
