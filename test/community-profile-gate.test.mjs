// Two real bugs, both reported by the user actually trying this: member
// search only fired on blur (a "change" listener), which looks completely
// broken to anyone typing and expecting results as they go; and a
// freshly-redeemed code landed straight on the mostly-empty Feed tab with
// no visible cue that a profile still needed to be created, so "did this
// even save?" had no clear answer. Both fixed by matching the app's own
// existing patterns: historySearch already uses a live "input" listener,
// and the invite-code/signed-out states already use an unskippable
// single-purpose gate instead of a normal tabbed screen.
