// WHAT THIS APP IS, and why the feature looks like this. Haimunia is
// POST-WORKOUT management: you open it to record what you did and to work out
// what to aim for next time. It is not a bar-side calculator, so there is no
// warmup ladder and no plate breakdown here - those answer "what do I do in
// the next ninety seconds", which is a question this app is not in the room
// for. The percentages are framed as the NEXT session and live where a lift
// is being reviewed.
//
// The reference is bestEst1RM() - an Epley estimate from real logged sets,
// not a tested single. Deliberate trade: it works for every member on day one
// with nothing to fill in, at the cost of being an estimate. A number derived
// from a 5-rep set can sit a few kg either side of a true max, so the panel
// says that plainly instead of presenting the figures as measured.
