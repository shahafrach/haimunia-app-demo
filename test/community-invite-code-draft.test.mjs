// Launch-readiness audit, RELIABILITY. Two real defects in the invite-code
// redemption step, both found by instrumenting a browser-check scenario
// that had been failing intermittently for weeks and was recorded as "flaky
// under CPU contention". It was neither flaky nor contention.
//
// DEFECT 1 - the typed code was erased by a background render.
//   This app re-renders by replacing #content's innerHTML wholesale. Any
//   render landing between a keystroke and the submit swapped the invite
//   form for a fresh, empty one, discarding what the member had typed. The
//   render that actually did it in practice is maybeAutoStartBackup()'s
//   "your workouts are backed up" message, which fires on the member's
//   first local write and lands, on a cold start, at exactly the wrong
//   moment. The member then submitted an empty field and was told the code
//   was required - for a code they had just typed.
//
// DEFECT 2 - a successful redemption could strand the member forever.
//   redeemCode() calls redeem_invite_code (which CONSUMES the code) and
//   then decides what to show from a follow-up READ of invite_redemptions.
//   One failed or racing read left the invite form on screen for a code
//   that was already spent - and re-submitting it now returns "invalid".
//   The account could not proceed, with no error and no way forward.
