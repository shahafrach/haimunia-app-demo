// Launch-readiness audit, SEC-018.
//
// The security pass flagged 37 innerHTML/outerHTML sinks in app.js and
// recorded confidence LOW, because it had sampled four of them rather than
// tracing all 37 - "worth doing before launch; not worth blocking on".
// This file is that pass, done mechanically so it also stays done.
//
// WHY app.js RATHER THAN cloud.js: cloud.js renders remote,
// attacker-influenced data and has ZERO innerHTML assignments (asserted
// below, so that stays true). app.js renders the LOCAL training log - but
// "local" is not the same as "trusted": records round-trip through
// private_records and come back from the network, and an import file is
// user-supplied. So the sinks are worth pinning even though the blast
// radius is self-XSS rather than cross-member.
//
// The rule enforced: every `${...}` inside an innerHTML/outerHTML
// assignment must be esc()-wrapped, a numeric coercion, or an identifier
// this file explicitly allow-lists as a proven constant. A new unwrapped
// interpolation fails here rather than shipping.
