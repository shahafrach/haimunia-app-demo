// Launch-readiness audit, SEC-018.
//
// The security pass flagged 37 innerHTML/outerHTML sinks in app.js and
// recorded confidence LOW, because it had sampled four of them rather than
// tracing all 37 - "worth doing before launch; not worth blocking on".
// This file is that pass, done mechanically so it also stays done.
//
// WHY app.js RATHER THAN cloud.js: cloud.js renders remote,
// attacker-influenced data and has ZERO innerHTML assignments (asserted
// below, so that stays true). app.js renders the LOCAL training log - but
// "local" is not the same as "trusted": records round-trip through
// private_records and come back from the network, and an import file is
// user-supplied. So the sinks are worth pinning even though the blast
// radius is self-XSS rather than cross-member.
//
// The rule enforced: every `${...}` inside an innerHTML/outerHTML
// assignment must be esc()-wrapped, a numeric coercion, or an identifier
// this file explicitly allow-lists as a proven constant. A new unwrapped
// interpolation fails here rather than shipping.

  // #supportBody, the same shape openAchievements()/renderNotificationsList()
  // already use for their own overlays. Checked rather than waved through,
  // since that is what this pin is for: the body interpolates exactly two

  // esc(supportDiagnostics()). The diagnostics string is the only one
  // carrying outside input at all (navigator.userAgent) and it is escaped.
  // The member's own typed description is NEVER interpolated - it is read
  // from the live textarea's .value at send time by supportReportText() and
  // handed to encodeURIComponent(), so it never re-enters the DOM as markup.
  //
  // 38 -> 40 on 2026-09-18: render() gained the desktop staff shell's context
  // column, which is two sinks on #contextCol - the write, and the `= ""`
  // reset in its own catch. Checked rather than waved through, which is what
  // this pin exists to force:
  //   * NEITHER LINE INTERPOLATES ANYTHING. One assigns the return value of
  //     window.renderStaffContextColumn() (a cloud.js function reached
  //     through a typeof guard), the other assigns an empty string literal.
  //     There is no `${...}` in either, so there is nothing in app.js for
  //     this file's escaping rule to check.
  //   * The markup itself is built in cloud.js, from the same coach section
  //     renderers the phone already uses, and cloud.js is asserted directly
  //     below to have ZERO innerHTML sinks of its own - it returns strings
  //     and app.js is the one that writes them, which is the arrangement
  //     this file is built around.
  //   * The one value that column composes itself is pendingModerationCount(),
  //     a .filter().length - provably an integer, the same class of value as
  //     computeCurrentStreak() in the PROVEN_SAFE list above. Every other
  //     interpolation in it goes through esc() or bidiText().
  //
  // 40 -> 41 on 2026-09-22: renderBenchmarkArea() writes the benchmark section
  // into #benchmarkArea on the progress screen. ONE sink, not the two the
  // obvious shape would have taken (a write plus an `= ""` early return for
  // the club_features gate) - the whole section is composed by
  // benchmarkSectionHtml() and the gate is a ternary on that one line, which
  // is what this pin is for: it made the author look. Checked rather than
  // waved through:
  //   * THE SINK LINE ITSELF INTERPOLATES NOTHING - it assigns either a
  //     function's return value or an empty string literal, so there is no
  //     `${...}` on it for the escaping test above to check.
  //   * What it composes is the member's OWN training log, but "local" is not
  //     "trusted" (these records round-trip through private_records and can
  //     arrive from an import file), so every value in it is escaped: movement
  //     names and WOD descriptions through bidiText(), which escapes; scores,
  //     dates, effort tags and the retest list through esc(); and the day
  //     counts are integers out of daysSinceISODate().
  //   * The eight benchmark names are WOD_LIBRARY literals in
  //     src/constants.js, not member input, and are escaped anyway.
  //
  // 41 -> 42 on 2026-09-22: render() now writes renderToastBar() into
  // #appToastDock instead of concatenating it into #content, so the save/undo
  // toast can be positioned against #bottomNavWrap rather than on top of the
  // save button (training-log UX review, finding 1). ONE new sink and no
  // markup that was not already reaching the DOM - the old #content write
  // carried the same string. Checked rather than waved through:
  //   * THE SINK LINE ITSELF INTERPOLATES NOTHING - `toastDock.innerHTML =
  //     renderToastBar()` assigns a function's return value, so there is no
  //     `${...}` on it for the escaping test above to check. Same shape as the
  //     #contextCol and #benchmarkArea entries above.
  //   * renderToastBar() composes exactly two outside values, and both are
  //     escaped where they are interpolated: the toast label through
  //     bidiText(), which escapes (src/shared/safe-helpers.js), and the undo
  //     action's own label through esc(). Every label passed to showToast() is
  //     built in app.js from literals plus movement/WOD names that have
  //     already been through bidiText()/esc() at their call sites.
  //   * The #content sink it came out of is unchanged in count: that line
  //     still writes content + cloudOverlay + renderAppConfirmSheet(), so this
  //     is +1, not a move that also removed one.
