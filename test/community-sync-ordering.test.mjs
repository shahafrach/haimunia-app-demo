// Found by an independent architecture review, not a user report:
// refreshSession() - the path that runs on every normal app open when a
// session already exists, the common case - pulled remote private
// records without first flushing the local outbox. A set logged offline
// seconds before reopening the app would get silently overwritten by the
// still-stale server copy: the outbox row survives and re-pushes later,
// but the UI visibly regresses in the meantime. The onAuthStateChange
// handler (fresh sign-in / token refresh only) already flushed before
// pulling; refreshSession() is the far more common path and was missing
// it. jsdom can't execute cloud.js (see community-invite-gate.test.mjs's
// own note on this), so this asserts the fix at the source-text level,
// same pattern as the other ordering-sensitive tests in this repo.
