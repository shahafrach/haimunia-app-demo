// Product decision: no real email is ever collected, sent, or required
// for community sign-in - a magic-link email often opens in whatever the
// phone's default browser is, not inside the installed home-screen PWA,
// landing the session somewhere other than where the person actually
// wanted to be. signInAnonymously() still exists, but only as a
// one-time, invisible bootstrap step for a brand-new signup, needed
// purely because redeem_invite_code requires some session to attach to.
// It is no longer the permanent identity: see
// community-username-password-auth.test.mjs for the username+password
// upgrade that replaces it immediately after redemption, which is what
// makes logging back in from a different device possible - something
// plain anonymous-only sign-in structurally couldn't offer, and the
// reason it stopped being the whole story.
