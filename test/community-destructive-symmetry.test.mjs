// Five-persona UX audit, defects 1 and 2, in the admin member-management
// panel and the moderation queue.
//
// DEFECT 1 - THE GUARD WAS ON THE WRONG DIRECTION. Granting coach opened a
// confirmation. Revoking the same permission fired on a single click, off a
// list of visually near-identical rows, with no dialog, no undo and an
// audit row written before the admin knew anything had happened. The same
// inversion existed one control over: head_coach -> coach ("הורדה למאמן/ת")
// opened the PROMOTION dialog, worded "להעניק הרשאת מאמן/ת" and styled
// non-destructively, so both directions of one control read alike.
//
// DEFECT 2 - NO CONFIRMATION NAMED ITS SUBJECT. "הגבלת פרסום קבועה" and
// "לחסום את המשתמש?" are dialogs opened FROM A LIST about a specific human,
// and neither said which one. That is the mechanism by which the wrong
// member gets actioned.
//
// THE ROUTE TAKEN, because a previous pass took a different one. Commit
// 05e1ee5 concluded askConfirm() "structurally cannot carry a name that
// mixes Latin and Hebrew" and built renderGhostReclaimSheet() as a
// dedicated dialog. That conclusion held for the MESSAGE field only - one
// flat esc()'d run, into which a name cannot be spliced without being
// reordered against the Hebrew around it, and into which a <bdi> cannot be
// spliced at all because esc() would render the tag as literal text. So the
// name no longer travels inside the message: the message carries a
// {subject} TOKEN, the name rides beside it as `subject`, and
// subjectSentenceHtml() joins the escaped sentence fragments around a
// bidiText()-isolated name. esc() runs over every part, nothing is
// bypassed, EVERY existing askConfirm call site is fixed at once, and
// CLOUD_DIALOGS stays at 13 (no fourth pattern - see the count pinned in
// community-state-namespaces.test.mjs).

  //   carry a term, a gloss, a body, an optional worked example and a
  //   second page (the full glossary) would have turned it into a general
  //   dialog framework, which is precisely what this pin exists to prevent.

  //   above it, applied in the other direction: a `?` marker can be rendered
  //   inside the challenge, event, recap and profile overlays' own content,
  //   so the term sheet paints on top of those and must be matched before
  //   them. It stays BELOW confirmSheet and outwardShare because neither of
  //   those can contain a term marker, so nothing can stack on top of it.
  //
  //   WHY IT IS ONE ENTRY AND NOT TWO. The full glossary is a second PAGE of
  //   this same sheet (state.ui.termGlossaryOpen), not a second dialog, so
  //   both pages share one focus trap, one Escape binding and one backdrop
  //   click instead of duplicating all three.
