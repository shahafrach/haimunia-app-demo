// THIS TEST USED TO ASSERT A BUG, and its own comment argued the bug was a
// feature. Until 202609070001, purge_abandoned_profiles() deleted a
// backup-only anonymous account 30 days after it was OPENED, and
// private_records cascades from auth.users - so a member who logged workouts
// for a month and never joined the community lost every entry they had, from
// their only server-side copy, silently. The policy described that as a
// retention limit and this test held the description in place, which is how a
// green suite came to certify data loss.
//
// 202609070001 is now the source of truth and the rule is different in kind,
// not in degree: an account holding ANY training data is removed from that
// job's population outright, under any window (account_holds_training_data(),
// which counts private_records by presence - soft-deleted rows included - plus
// any attendance_log row), and the clock is last activity rather than account
// age. What is still collected is a shell that was opened for backup and never
// had anything backed up to it.
//
// So the disclosure this suite has to hold is now TWO facts, not one, and the
// second is the one that matters to a member: the window exists, AND a log is
// never inside it. The doesNotMatch guard is the point of the test - the old
// promise is a sentence somebody could plausibly reintroduce while "restoring
// the retention limit", and it must not come back without this failing.
