// UX finding, deferred from the earlier audit-fixes batch: tapping
// "השוואה" on a feed post rendered the comparison result at the top of
// the whole feed, not under the post that triggered it - scrolled far
// down, the result appeared somewhere the viewer had to scroll back up
// to find, with no visual link to which post it was for. Now tracked
// per-post (state.comparisonForPostId) and rendered inline inside that
// post's own card; a second tap on the same post's button closes it.
