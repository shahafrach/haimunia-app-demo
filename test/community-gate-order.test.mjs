// Design spec section 7 — THE COMMUNITY GATE WAS BACKWARDS.
//
// The gate led with a login form and a 56px primary `התחברות ושחזור החשבון`,
// for an account the arriving member does not have. The path every arriving
// member actually needs — `חבר/ה חדש/ה? התחלת הרשמה עם קוד הזמנה` — was the
// smallest, lowest-contrast thing on the screen: a 13px underlined .link-btn
// at the bottom.
//
// For a club rolling this out to a cohort, EVERY arriving member is new, so
// the primary action was the one almost nobody needed. Three personas hit it
// independently; the beginner's verbatim first reaction was "I don't have a
// username. Did I already sign up and forget? Did I do something wrong?" — a
// member blaming herself for the app's ordering.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE MEASURES, and why it is executing rather than source-text:
// the claim being made is about a PATH (how many screens, how many taps, how
// prominent the needed action is), and a regex over cloud.js cannot see a
// path. These boot the real app against a mock Supabase and walk it.
//
// THE HEADLINE NUMBER IS NOT THE TAP COUNT. Cold arrival was two screens and
// two taps to reach the code field before this change, and it is two screens
// and two taps after it. What changed is WHICH action is primary at each
// step, and that is what the assertions below pin: the needed action goes
// from a 13px underlined link to the screen's .save-btn, and a cold arriving
// member is no longer shown a credential form they cannot fill.
