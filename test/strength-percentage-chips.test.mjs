// The percentage chips on the log screen, behind club_features.strength_percentages.
//
// WHAT THIS IS. The app already showed percentages of a movement's estimated
// 1RM, in a collapsed table you read and then dialled in by hand. The chips
// are the same numbers as buttons that fill the weight stepper, carried down
// to 50%, rounded to a jump the member's own gym can actually load.
//
// THE THREE THINGS THIS FILE IS FOR, all of them ways the feature could ship
// broken in a way nobody would notice until a member complained:
//
//  1. ROUNDING. A percentage of an Epley estimate is a number like
//     110.86499999999999. Printed raw it is useless; rounded to the wrong
//     step it is a bar nobody can load. Every chip, at every increment, has
//     to be a real multiple - and a member who chose 1 kg must not be handed
//     2.5s.
//  2. NO 1RM. A movement with no logged sets has no estimate, and a
//     percentage of nothing is not 0 kg - it is nothing. The surface must be
//     absent, not empty, and not present with zeros in it.
//  3. THE KEY OFF. The row for this key is being added on another branch. So
//     the default with no row at all is the state nearly every member is in
//     right now, and it has to be "exactly what shipped before" - not a
//     half-rendered new surface, and not both surfaces at once.
