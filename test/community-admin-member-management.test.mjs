// member or change their role/remove them short of the Supabase SQL
// editor. Admin-only search by handle/name or an exact pasted user id,
// backed by a dedicated RPC (matching the same is_admin-only pattern as
// review_report/the moderation visibility policy, not the broader
// coach-inclusive is_staff()) since invite_redemptions and
// activity_pings aren't readable cross-user otherwise. Also asked for
// directly: "i also need user + id in the siupbase" - a dashboard-only
// view (admin_user_directory) for browsing id<->handle<->role directly
// in the Supabase SQL/Table editor, no grants to the app's own API roles.
