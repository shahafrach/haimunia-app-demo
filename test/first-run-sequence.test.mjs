// Design spec §1 — the first-run sequence.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR. The audit's top-ranked friction finding was that a
// new member's first load stacked four surfaces that each wanted something
// before the app had given them anything: the welcome sheet (name AND
// box-start date), the five-screen explainer as a gate, a celebration, and
// the install banner — with two consecutive primary buttons carrying the
// identical string בואו נתחיל. 8afbc57 fixed the STACKING (one modal queue).
// This is the SEQUENCE, and these are the assertions that keep it sequenced.
//
// Each test below pins one of the five deferrals §1.2 makes, and every one of
// them is a claim about behaviour a member can feel, not about markup:
// how many things are in front of them, what the app asks for and when, and
// whether an answer they gave is remembered.
