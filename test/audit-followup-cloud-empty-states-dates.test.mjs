// Three findings the five-persona UX audit left open, all inside cloud.js.
//
//  1. The coach dashboard's and analytics cards' empty states were bare
//     one-liners, against a design spec (§2.1) that asks for four slots:
//     icon / forward-looking headline / one line of explanation / a real
//     >=44px action - or, where no honest action exists, a `when`.
//  2. <input type="date"> renders mm/dd/yyyy on an en-US browser profile in
//     a Hebrew RTL app. The beginner persona typed 01/06/2026 meaning
//     1 June and the app stored 6 January. The VALUE always round-trips
//     (type=date submits ISO); the defect is what she reads while typing.
//  3. The composer's "image is decorative" checkbox row was the only one in
//     the file missing the shared `field` wrapper its siblings all use.
//
// Driven through the real render path (bootCommunity + the mock Supabase
// client) wherever the finding is about what a member SEES; source-text
// assertions only for the invariants that are about the shape of the code
// itself (which call sites exist, which tone rules hold across all of them).
