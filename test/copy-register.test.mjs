// Two copy findings left open by the five-persona UX audit, plus the
// same-class strings found next to them. All of these are one failure mode:
// a member-facing string that names an INTERNAL concept - how a developer
// thinks about the thing - instead of naming what the member is looking at.
//
// Finding 1 (design spec §4.4). The settings block above "delete all data"
// was headed `אזור מסוכן`, a literal calque of "danger zone", printed in
// var(--red-text). The beginner persona (49, comfortable with WhatsApp and
// online banking) read it as the app warning her that something was wrong
// with her PHONE. That is the exact inversion of the heading's purpose: it
// exists to slow her down before a destructive control, and instead it made
// a cautious member think the app was reporting a fault she had to deal
// with. A red warning printed before she has touched anything is
// indistinguishable from an error message.
//
// Finding 2 (design spec Appendix A.9). `בואו נתחיל להתאמן` in the desktop
// sidebar / nav card was the THIRD instance of `בואו נתחיל` in the app -
// and the odd one out, because the other two are primary BUTTONS
// (index.html's welcome sheet and onboarding explainer) while this one is
// the `.who-sub` status line directly under the member's name. A member
// with no current streak had their state reported to them as an imperative.
//
// These tests pin the replacements. No pre-existing test asserted on either
// old string, so nothing here supersedes an earlier assertion - the two
// source-level guards below exist so a revert cannot pass silently.
