// reproduced in real Chromium first, all of the same family: a rule that was
// written down in one place and quietly not honored in another.
//
// The through-line worth remembering: every one of these lost or corrupted a
// member's own training data SILENTLY. Nothing threw, nothing warned, and the
// app kept rendering a confident number that was no longer what the member
// typed. A training log's whole value is that last week's entry still says
// what last week said.
