// Five-persona UX audit: no raw server string reaches a Hebrew-speaking
// member.
//
// WHAT WAS WRONG. Every write in this app ends at a Postgres function that
// refuses with a bare English wire code - 'posting_restricted', 'recovery
// method required', 'rate_limited', 'not authorized'. renderOutboxBanner()
// took the queue's stored lastError and printed it, so a failed write
// painted a card that read, in full:
//
//     פוסט
//     posting_restricted
//
// Two personas hit this. For one of them it was how they discovered they had
// been moderated at all: an English enum, no statement of what the sanction
// covers, and a "ניסיון חוזר" button next to it that could never work.
//
// WHY THE STRINGS BELOW ARE THE REAL ONES. They were not copied out of the
// migrations by eye. Each was produced by calling the real RPC against the
// local Supabase stack as an affected member and recording the message that
// came back - a member with recovery_verified_at unset answers 'recovery
// method required' on feed_page AND post_create AND community_search; a
// member with a live posting_restrictions row answers 'posting_restricted'
// on post_create and add_post_comment while feed_page and toggle_reaction
// still return 200. That last pair is what licenses the Hebrew sentence to
// promise that reading and cheering still work.
//
// THE LOAD-BEARING ASSERTION is the negative one: RAW_SERVER_STRINGS is
// swept against the rendered DOM after every failure, so a future error path
// that forgets to map its message fails this file rather than shipping
// English to a member.
