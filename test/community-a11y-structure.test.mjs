// Launch-readiness audit, A1 and A2: the Community module's document
// structure.
//
// A NOTE ON WHAT THE AUDIT ACTUALLY FOUND. The finding was recorded as
// "the entire Community module ships 5 heading elements", measured with
// `grep -oE "<h[1-6]" cloud.js`. That counts SOURCE occurrences, and this
// file builds its headings through helpers - sectionHead() emits an <h2>
// and is called 36 times, and 20 more card titles emit an <h3>. The module
// therefore renders on the order of 56 headings, not 5, and the severity
// was overstated by the measurement rather than by the code.
//
// Two things in that finding were nonetheless real and are fixed here:
//   * every dialog's title was a <div>, so none of the 13 dialogs appeared
//     in heading navigation even though each was correctly NAMED via
//     aria-labelledby;
//   * the tab pattern was half-declared - tabs with role="tab" but no
//     aria-controls, and a role="tabpanel" with no accessible name (A1).
