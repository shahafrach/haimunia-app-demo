# BOX-LOG, Direction 06 design handoff

This package defines the approved Club Balance design for the complete app.

## Product rule

The workout tools are for post-workout management. Users record, edit, review, and manage completed workouts after training. Do not introduce live timers, rest counters, live coaching, or urgent in-session interaction.

## Visual direction

- Clean, calm, welcoming, and practical.
- Light and dark themes share identical layouts and hierarchy.
- Real club photography connects the digital product to the physical location.
- Photos support orientation and identity. Data and controls always sit on solid surfaces.
- Red and warm-white stripes are a signature accent. Keep them below 10 percent of the visible app area.
- Use warm cream, royal blue, deep navy, powder blue, coral red, and restrained steel tones.
