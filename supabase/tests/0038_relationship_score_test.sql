-- COMM-301: behavioural coverage for 202608310002 (relationship_score, and
-- feed_page re-created to call it).
--
-- This is a refactor ticket, so the highest-value assertions here are not
-- "does the new function work" but "did anything move". Two of them do that
-- job and the rest support them:
--
--   1. A REGRESSION PIN on feed_page's actual output. Three posts, identical
--      in every scored respect except who wrote them, are ranked and their
--      feed_score values asserted to six decimal places against literals
--      captured by running this exact fixture against the pre-refactor
--      function. now() is fixed for the whole transaction, and the fixture
--      posts are published at now() - 5 hours, so the recency term is
--      40 * 0.5^(5/36) exactly - every number below is reproducible, not
--      approximate. If the extraction changed any arithmetic anywhere in
--      feed_page's scoring pass, these three numbers move and this fails.
--
--   2. A DRIFT PIN tying the two copies together, the same pattern
--      0034_feed_leaderboard_and_suggestions_test.sql uses for
--      consistency_week_streaks() versus community_profile: the gap between
--      two feed rows that differ only in their author is asserted equal to
--      18 (feed_page's relationship weight) times the gap between the same
--      two members' relationship_score(). feed_page cannot start scoring
--      relationships differently from the function it calls without this
--      failing, which is the whole point of extracting it.
--
-- Plus the boundaries: the function is internal (no grant to any client
-- role, security invoker), it agrees with are_friends() on who is mutual,
-- the 0.55 + 0.45 sum really is capped at 1, p_as_of really moves the 30-day
-- window, and the COMM-125 block edge feed_page already respected is not
-- loosened. people_suggestions (COMM-232) is asserted untouched.
--
-- CI is the first real run of this file.
