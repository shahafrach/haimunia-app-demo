-- COMM-374. admin_member_roster (202609030005_member_roster.sql).
--
-- Two boundaries matter here and both are asserted in both directions:
--   1. is_staff(), not is_admin() - a COACH can browse the roster, which
--      admin_search_members deliberately does not allow. A plain member
--      cannot.
--   2. Browsing grants nothing. The roster is read-only; the role-change
--      RPCs keep their own inline is_admin() check, so the coach who can
--      now see every member still cannot promote one. That is asserted
--      here rather than left to the client disabling a button.
