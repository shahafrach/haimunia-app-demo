-- COMM-107: behavioural coverage for 202608290014, the POST_NEW_MEMBER
-- producer that was specified in Phase 1, rendered by cloud.js since Phase 1,
-- and never actually built as a server insert until now.
--
-- What this file has to prove, in order of how badly each would hurt:
--
-- 1. The shape. renderNewMemberPostCard and test/community-post-cards.test.mjs
--    are already shipped and already read {member_id, member_name, joined_on}.
--    If this insert writes any other shape the card silently degrades in
--    members' hands with nothing failing anywhere. So the metadata keys, and
--    the JSON type of member_id (the client compares it with === against a
--    uuid string), are asserted directly rather than via a count.
--
-- 2. Both triggers. invite_redemptions now carries two AFTER INSERT ROW
--    triggers - this one and seed_onboarding_progress (202608290011). Postgres
--    documents that all matching triggers fire, but "documented" is not
--    "true in this database", and a regression where adding the second one
--    quietly cost us the first would break onboarding for every new member.
--    One insert, both effects asserted.
--
-- 3. Exactly one post per member, ever. A duplicate welcome post is visible
--    club-wide and cannot be undone by the member it is about.
--
-- 4. The join-ordering reality. A redemption lands BEFORE the profile exists
--    (profiles_insert_self requires the redemption), so the common production
--    case is "no profile to read a name from". That must produce a post
--    anyway, with member_name absent rather than placeholder-filled, and must
--    not create or wait for a profile.
--
-- 5. The post is actually reachable. An authorless row has null author_id,
--    which flows through posts_feed_select's blocks subquery and its
--    author_id = auth.uid() branch. If null broke either, the post would
--    exist and be invisible to everyone.
--
-- 6. The producer is server-only. Nothing client-side may call it.
