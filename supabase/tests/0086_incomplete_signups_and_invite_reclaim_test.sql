-- Five-persona UX audit, defect 3 (202609060023). Ghost accounts are
-- visible, and the invite they are holding is reclaimable.
--
-- WHAT WAS BROKEN. Signup is two-stage: redeem_invite_code() consumes the
-- invite, and the profiles row is written only after a three-slide carousel.
-- Abandon the carousel and what is left is a real authenticated account with
-- a spent invite and NO profiles row - which makes it invisible to every
-- roster surface in the module, because all of them start `from
-- public.profiles`, and untouchable by purge_abandoned_profiles(), because
-- that job requires the account to have NEVER redeemed.
--
-- The first assertion below is the shape of the hole itself, so the file
-- fails loudly if a future change makes a ghost visible some other way and
-- these functions become redundant.

-- Section 6 below is about what happens to a ghost's WELCOME POST when their
-- invite is reclaimed, so this file needs welcome posts to exist at all.
-- 202609160004 made them a club_features choice that ships OFF - the owner's
-- call, 2026-09-16 - and the trigger reads the flag at insert time, so the
-- switch has to precede the fixture redemptions rather than follow them.
-- 0033 owns the gate's own coverage, on and off; this file only needs the
-- producer running so the retraction has something to retract.
