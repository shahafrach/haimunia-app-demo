-- COMM-303: behavioural coverage for 202608310006 (member_feed_weights,
-- feed_weights_resolve, the recompute_feed_weights stub, and feed_page
-- re-created to read per-user weights).
--
-- THE LOAD-BEARING ASSERTION IN THIS FILE IS THE ONE THAT PROVES NOTHING
-- HAPPENED. COMM-303's most important acceptance criterion is that a member
-- with no stored weights gets exactly today's feed order, so this ticket
-- changes no existing feed order until a weight is actually personalized.
-- Section D asserts that directly, against the SAME three fixture posts and
-- the SAME three six-decimal-place literals 0038 captured from feed_page as
-- it stood BEFORE COMM-301 - so those numbers have now survived three
-- re-creations of this function unchanged. It asserts it five times over: no
-- row at all, a row holding the empty object, a row of explicit all-1.0
-- multipliers, a row where every multiplier is at the 2.5 ceiling (a uniform
-- boost is not a boost - it cancels in the rescale), and a row of pure junk.
--
-- The rest:
--   A. member_feed_weights' boundary. Own-row read and NOTHING else: no
--      insert, update or delete grant and no policy for any of the three,
--      counted from pg_policies so a later addition fails here rather than
--      slipping in. service_role writes it; anon cannot reach it at all.
--   B/C. The two new functions' reachability. feed_weights_resolve is
--      internal with no grant to any role; recompute_feed_weights is
--      service_role only AND IS A NO-OP - asserted as such, because a stub
--      that quietly started writing rows would personalize every member's
--      feed from a heuristic nobody reviewed.
--   E. A stored row really does move the score, in the expected direction
--      and by the expected amount, and the components nobody boosted really
--      do go down - emphasis moved, not added.
--   F. THE SUM INVARIANT. Over seven pathological stored rows: the resolved
--      set sums to the defaults' own total, and every component stays inside
--      0.40..2.50 of its own default. One of the seven is exactly the case a
--      naive clamp-then-rescale gets wrong.
--   G. v_w_class moves like any other weight - at the resolver and in a real
--      ranked feed against a real attendance overlap.
--   H. COMM-112 diversity still runs after personalized scoring, unchanged,
--      structurally and behaviourally.
--
-- CI is the first real run of this file.

-- touch them), same visibility, same published_at, no reactions, no
-- comments, no mention of the viewer, three different non-staff authors.
-- Every difference in their final score is therefore the relationship term
-- and nothing else - which is what makes the gaps in section E readable as a
-- weight.
--
-- A FOURTH post is added beyond 0038's fixture, by a member the viewer has
-- no edge with of any kind. It scores on recency ALONE, so its total is the
-- recency weight times the half-life factor and nothing else - which makes
-- it the one row in this file that reads a single weight directly, and the
-- row section E uses to show the un-boosted components really do go down.
