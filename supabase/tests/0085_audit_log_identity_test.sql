-- - eight characters of a uuid and a relative time. No admin name, no target
-- member, no record of WHICH decision was taken, no note. Reviewing,
-- defending or reversing that decision was impossible from the log, which is
-- the only reason a log exists.
--
-- Every assertion below is one of those five missing facts, on a real write
-- through the real function, not on a hand-inserted row: admin_actions has
-- no INSERT grant and no INSERT policy at all, so log_admin_action() is the
-- only way a row can exist.

-- became the staff who could read the record. The gate is is_admin() now,
-- which is behaviour-preserving for admin and owner, the only roles that had
-- analytics.view before. This assertion proves the head coach specifically is
-- shut out, which is the case the re-gate exists for.
