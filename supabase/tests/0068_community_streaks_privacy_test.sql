-- Launch-readiness audit, finding 2 (202609060002). community_streaks now
-- applies the privacy toggles every sibling leaderboard surface applies.
--
-- PORTED TO THE FUNCTION 2026-09-15 (202609150001, contract phase). Every
-- assertion below was written against the VIEW public.community_streaks,
-- which no longer exists - the Security Advisor's security_definer_view
-- finding is on the view, so closing it meant dropping it. The reads are now
-- public.community_streaks(100) calls and the boundary being asserted is unchanged,
-- which is the point: the finding was about the OBJECT SHAPE, never about
-- these rules, and this file is the evidence that contracting cost none of
-- them. Kept rather than deleted because two of its cases - in_leaderboards
-- off on its own, and visible_to_club off on its own - are not covered
-- anywhere else; 0093 only tests all three toggles off together, and "the
-- combination refuses" does not prove "each column refuses independently".
--
-- THE VECTOR THIS FILE REPRODUCES, verified live before the fix: a member
-- switches visible_to_club, in_leaderboards AND show_attendance all off and
-- is still fully readable through this view - handle, display name, streak
-- length and a raw last_activity_on date - by any authenticated caller. The
-- view is deliberately not security_invoker (it has to aggregate past
-- activity_pings' owner-only RLS), which is exactly why it has to re-apply
-- every rule by hand, and it only ever re-applied two of them.
--
-- THE ONE DELIBERATE ASYMMETRY, asserted below rather than left to the
-- migration comment: show_attendance gates the last_activity_on COLUMN, not
-- the row. It is the only raw per-day date here and it defaults to FALSE,
-- while visible_to_club and in_leaderboards default to true; gating the row
-- on it would empty the view for the whole club for a toggle whose subject
-- (verified class attendance) this view's source - activity_pings, days the
-- member opened the app - does not expose.
