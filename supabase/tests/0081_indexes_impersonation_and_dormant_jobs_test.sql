-- two assertions here used to read the literal back out of prosrc, and that
-- refactor broke them in the two different ways a textual guard breaks:
-- the first went RED, and the second went VACUOUSLY GREEN - `not like
-- '%interval ''8 days''%'` is trivially true of a body that no longer
-- contains any window at all, so it would have gone on passing forever while
-- asserting nothing. Only the red one announced itself.
--
-- Both are restated against the helper, which is where the rule lives now,
-- and both are behavioural rather than textual: they CALL the function and
-- compare intervals instead of grepping its source. A future move cannot
-- make these pass by accident the way the second one just did.
