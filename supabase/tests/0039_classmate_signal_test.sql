-- COMM-302: behavioural coverage for 202608310003 (classmate_day_counts, and
-- feed_page + people_suggestions re-created to use it).
--
-- The ticket names five boundaries and every one of them gets a direct
-- assertion here rather than an indirect one:
--
--   1. A pair that shared training days scores ABOVE a pair that shared none,
--      in feed_page, by exactly the normalised amount - three posts identical
--      in every scored respect except their author's overlap with the viewer,
--      with the gaps between their feed_score values asserted as well as the
--      absolute values. 4 shared days out of the 8-day saturation is exactly
--      half of v_w_class; 1 day is exactly an eighth; 8 and 12 days are both
--      exactly all of it, which is what "capped at 1 before the weight
--      applies" has to mean.
--   2. people_suggestions returns 'classmate' as a reason with the right
--      shared_classmate_days count, and the three pre-existing signals keys
--      are still there under their old names with their old meanings.
--   3. The new priority order - challenge, classmate, interaction, event -
--      holds across four candidates each carrying a different strongest
--      signal, and holds LEXICOGRAPHICALLY: one shared challenge outranks
--      four shared training days, and four shared training days outrank a
--      shared reaction.
--   4. show_attendance off on the candidate zeroes the signal in BOTH
--      functions while their attendance_log rows still exist - asserted by
--      flipping the toggle on an unchanged set of rows and watching the same
--      data go from nothing to a full signal and back. That is the
--      difference between "no data" and "private data", and it is the whole
--      point of the toggle.
--   5. A block edge in EITHER direction removes the pair from both functions
--      and from the helper, whatever the overlap would have been.
--
-- The caller for every substantive assertion is tests.uid('m1'), a plain
-- member. can_view_profile_field() short-circuits true for is_admin(), so a
-- privacy test run as an admin would pass whatever the toggles said and prove
-- nothing - the same reason 0034 gives for the same choice.
--
-- CI is the first real run of this file.
