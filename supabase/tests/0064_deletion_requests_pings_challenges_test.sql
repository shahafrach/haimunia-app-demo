-- On weekly_challenges' `using (true)`: it is deliberate, not an oversight,
-- and this file locks the intent in rather than narrowing it. The table
-- holds club-wide programming written BY staff FOR the whole box - a title,
-- a comparison_key and a date window, no member data of any kind - and it
-- is the fallback the home mark renders when public.challenges is empty
-- (202608280019_feed_ranking.sql). Its peers agree: announcements_read,
-- challenges_read and events_read are all club-wide-to-any-authenticated
-- too, differing only by the status/expiry/feature-flag axes that
-- weekly_challenges (single club, no draft state, no feature flag) does not
-- have. The privacy boundary here is the WRITE side, and that is what the
-- insert assertions below pin down.
--
-- Two behaviours worth naming up front, both asserted below because they
-- are easy to misremember:
--   * A missing INSERT policy is an ERROR (42501). A missing UPDATE/DELETE
--     policy is a SILENT NO-OP - the USING filter matches no rows, so the
--     statement succeeds having changed nothing. activity_pings and
--     weekly_challenges both still carry Supabase's default UPDATE/DELETE
--     grants for `authenticated` (they were created in 202608270001, one
--     migration before 202608270002 tightened the default privileges), so
--     RLS is the only thing standing there. It holds.
--   * account_deletion_requests is the opposite shape: the GRANT is the
--     wall (select only), so every client write dies at 42501 before RLS is
--     ever consulted.

--     "מעולם לא" ("never"). On a club whose members had not yet produced
--     pings that reported every member, staff included, as never active.
--   * Eligibility now requires having been a member since before the
--     window. The fixture coach redeemed `now()`, so under the new rule
