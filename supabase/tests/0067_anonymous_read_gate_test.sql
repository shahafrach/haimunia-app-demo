-- Launch-readiness audit, finding 1 (202609060001). The anonymous read gate.
--
-- THE VECTOR THIS FILE REPRODUCES. Anonymous sign-in is enabled and the
-- publishable key ships in the browser, so anyone can mint a real
-- `authenticated` JWT with a real auth.uid() and NOTHING else: no invite
-- redemption, no profile row, no recovery method. tests.set_auth() produces
-- exactly that state for any uuid that has no fixture rows behind it, which
-- is what the 'ghost' session below is - the same shape the live probe used.
--
-- The three questions this file has to answer separately, because conflating
-- them is how the hole got shipped:
--   1. a ghost session reads NOTHING of the club                (the fix)
--   2. a mid-onboarding member still reads their OWN profile row (the
--      regression the fix must not cause - without it the client can never
--      read back the profile it just created and the member is stranded on
--      the "complete your profile" form forever)
--   3. the three pre-redemption content surfaces stay open      (the
--      deliberate exception, which the security review asked for by name)
