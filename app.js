// "Community needs a full-page sub-nav of its own once signed in, not a
// single tap target." Revisited: that reasoning doesn't actually hold once
// you notice the WOD tab already carries its own sub-nav (Log/History/
// Benchmarks) while living in the bottom bar - "has sub-screens" was never
// really disqualifying. Community is now `main: true` too, exactly the
// same footing as WOD: one tap from anywhere, its own on-screen subtabbar
// (cloud.js's `.subtabbar`, `setCommunityTab`) handles Feed/Boards/Coach/
// Account navigation once you're on the tab, same as WOD's own subtabbar
// handles Log/History/Benchmarks. `.tabbtn{flex:1}` (index.html) has no
// hardcoded child count, so a 5th icon costs each ~20% width, nothing more.
// The mobile hamburger's Community row and its `.subnav` preview
// (renderNavRows' onlyOther branch below) naturally stop appearing there
// once this flips - onlyOther now returns nothing to show, and the on-
// screen subtabbar is real Community navigation now, not a fallback for a
// preview that's gone. The desktop sidebar (onlyOther=false) is unaffected,
// since it already showed every item including the preview regardless.

// lookup table. Keyed by this app's REAL tab ids (confirmed against

// "calendar" is the reference's "History" screen (month grid + day list),
// "history" is the reference's "Progress" screen (already labelled
// "התקדמות" and already the PR/chart tab) - see CHANGES.md for the mapping
// reasoning. "wod" (Library) and Settings are intentionally absent: Library
// gets its own scene once implemented, Settings stays a solid surface per
// IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md §8's own instruction not to immerse it.
// ONLY list a tab here once its render function actually returns the
// .scene-page/.scene-sheet markup. body[data-scene]'s CSS (header goes
// transparent/absolute, brand-stripe hides, bottom bar goes dark) applies
// unconditionally the moment a tab's key is a member of this object -
// registering a tab before its content is restructured breaks that tab's
// EXISTING layout instead of leaving it untouched (found live: registering
// "community" here before Community had scene markup floated its header
// over ordinary dialog content and blocked a real button underneath it -
// community-recap-classmates.mjs's browser-check scenario caught this

  // half of it inert - see cloud.js's renderManagePanel(). Second, both are
  // main:false, which is what puts them in the hamburger: this registry feeds
  // BOTH the bottom bar (main:true only) and the hamburger
  // (renderNavRows(true, true), non-main only), so flipping the flag moves
  // them from one to the other with no second navigation mechanism. That also
  // hands the 6th bottom slot back to the five member tabs, which is where a
  // phone-sized bottom bar wants to be.
  //
  // WHY THESE TWO ROWS ARE NOT GATED ON WHO IS SIGNED IN (2026-09-15, third
  // revision). They used to appear only for a member whose own account was
  // staff. That stopped being possible when management became a SEPARATE
  // IDENTITY - "no, i want it to be seperate from the regular user". The
  // owner trains on an account that deliberately holds no admin power, so a
  // staff check against the signed-in member now hides these rows from
  // exactly the person they exist for, and there is no other way in.
  //
  // Showing them to everyone gives nothing away and grants nothing. Each row
  // lands on a locked gate that wants a management email and password, and
  // every RPC behind that gate is RLS-enforced server-side against the
  // management account's own JWT - a member who taps through sees a login
  // form and stops there. The alternative, some hidden gesture only the owner
  // knows, would be a secret that protects nothing while being impossible to
  // hand to a new head coach. A visible, locked door is the honest shape.
  //
  // The moderation badge is deliberately NOT on these rows any more: it
  // counted a queue the signed-in member could see, and a member cannot see
  // that queue. A count rendered for everyone would be both meaningless and a
  // small leak of club state to people with no part in it.
  //
  // UNCONDITIONAL, including when nobody is signed in at all (2026-09-15,
  // corrected). A previous version required a community session on the device,
  // on the reasoning that two management doors are clutter for someone who has
  // never joined the club. That reasoning was wrong, and the way it was wrong
  // is the whole point of this design:
  //
  //   "I want a sign in option only to admin and head coach - they are not
  //    related to the actual user using app, it's different."
  //
  // Management is not a privilege some member holds. It is a SEPARATE LOGIN,
  // and the person who needs it may well not be a member of this club on this
  // device at all - the owner, signed out, on a phone that has just been
  // wiped, is exactly the case. Requiring a member session first made the
  // management door reachable only by first becoming the thing management is
  // deliberately not.
  //
  // Nothing is given away by showing them. Each opens onto a gate that wants
  // management credentials, and every RPC behind it is RLS-enforced against
  // the management account's own JWT.

         many for the one thing a member does when the app is misbehaving. The
         moment you most need to report a fault is the moment you are least
         inclined to go looking for where to do it.
         It STAYS in Settings as well. This is not a move: the two places
         answer different questions - "something is broken right now" belongs
         on the menu you already have open, and "where do I get help" belongs
         under עזרה with the rest of it. Both routes call the same openSupport().
         In renderNavSettingsRow rather than renderNavMenuList so the desktop
         sidebar gets it too - they share this function, and a desktop user
         reporting a fault should not have to find a hamburger that is not
         there.
         No dispatcher change was needed: openSupport() closes the nav menu on
         its first line already. I added a closeNavMenu() here anyway and wrote
         a comment about the stacked overlays it prevented, then reverted it to
         confirm the test caught it - and nothing failed, because there was
         nothing to catch. -->

// A real, user-reported bug: on Chrome/Android, "every time I open the app

// (welcome / onboarding / release-notes) is open, document.body.style.overflow
// is "hidden" (each open*() below sets it), which keeps the page unscrollable
// - and Chrome will not collapse its own URL bar while the page can't scroll.
// Closing the modal restores scrollability, but the browser only re-collapses
// its chrome in response to an actual scroll gesture, not automatically. Until
// that happens, #bottomBar/#bottomTabBar (position:fixed; bottom:0) are laid
// out against the taller, stale viewport and sit visibly higher than their
// real resting place - exactly "a bit up" - until the user's own first scroll
// fixes it. A version bump (like this session's) makes this hit almost every
// returning member on their next open, since openNotifications() below is
// what shows them "what's new".
//
// Fix: nudge the browser into recalculating immediately instead of waiting
// for the user. #app's own bottom padding (200px + safe-area-inset-bottom)

// ---------- Support and bug reporting ----------
// Added 2026-09-15, straight out of the first real-phone session this app
// ever had. Four things were reported as "not working" that day, and the
// only reason they reached anybody is that the person holding the phone was
// also the person who could fix them. A member has no such channel: the app
// has never had a single route for "this is broken" or "I need help", so
// every one of those reports would have ended as a shrug, or as a message in
// the club WhatsApp group that nobody with the code ever reads.
//
// WHY THIS LIVES IN app.js AND NOT cloud.js. Community is opt-in, and the
// training log works with no account, no network and no Supabase at all. A
// member who never joined Community is exactly as entitled to report a bug as
// one who did - more so, since the offline log is the part they use daily.
// Putting this in cloud.js would have made "can I ask for help" depend on
// having said yes to a social feed.
//
// WHY IT HANDS OFF INSTEAD OF WRITING TO THE DATABASE. Reporting a bug is
// precisely the moment the app might be the broken thing. A table write needs
// a live client, a network, a valid session and an intact RLS path - four
// things a bug report should never be gated on. Composing the text locally
// and handing it to WhatsApp or mail costs none of them, works in airplane
// mode, and leaves the member holding their own copy of what they sent.

// one of them is about the DEVICE, not the person. The member can read the

// ---------- First-run sequencing (design spec §1) ----------
//
// THE FINDING. A new member's first load used to stack four surfaces that
// each wanted something before the app had given them anything: the welcome
// sheet (name AND box-start date), the five-screen explainer as a gate, an
// achievement celebration, and the install banner. Two of those carried a
// primary button reading the identical string בואו נתחיל, which is why the
// flow read as "not progressing" rather than as two steps. The stacking half
// of that was fixed in 8afbc57 (one modal queue); this is the SEQUENCE half.
//
// THE RULE, and it is the only rule here: one surface at a time, and nothing
// costs the member anything until the app has given them something. Concretely
// that means each ask is deferred to the moment the member can actually answer
// it from experience rather than on faith:
//
//   name          -> S1, the one blocking sheet, one field, skippable
//   the tour      -> S2, a card on the logging screen, never a gate, and
//                    permanently re-openable from Settings
//   box-start date-> off first run entirely (Settings + the achievements
//                    screen's own prompt card, which is where a member is
//                    actually looking at the tenure badges it unlocks)
//   cloud backup  -> S5, after the first entry exists, because "back up your
//                    workouts" is a meaningless question to someone who has
//                    no workouts
//   install       -> S6, day two, because "keep this app" is a meaningless
//                    question on the first minute of the first day
//
// Everything below is bookkeeping for those five deferrals.

// The calendar date of the very first open. S6 needs it to answer "is this a
// different day from the day they installed", which is not the same question
// as "has time passed" and cannot be reconstructed from the entry log (a
// member can log a set dated last week on their first day).

// on an otherwise empty screen is answered by whoever actually wants it, and
// it is still there tomorrow for whoever did not.
//
// PLACEMENT NOTE, and it is a deliberate departure from the spec's wording.
// §1.2 S2 says "directly under the page title, above מה עשינו היום?". That
// puts a tour advertisement above the app's primary control on the first
// screen a member ever sees, which is the same mistake the install banner
// makes, one size smaller - and it contradicts the spec's own next sentence,
// which describes this as "the second-most prominent thing after the
// exercise picker". It renders directly BELOW the picker instead: on a
// first-run screen that is otherwise a paragraph of grey text and a large
// void, nothing above the fold competes with it, and the app's whole job
// stays the first thing on the page.
//
// PROMINENCE, revisited. The sentence above ("nothing above the fold
// competes with it") was true only because the picker above it was styled
// as flatly as this card was. Now that the picker reads as the primary
// action it is meant to be, an optional one-minute explainer wearing a
// brass border, a filled surface and a card shadow was the second-loudest
// thing on the screen and out of proportion to what it offers. It keeps its
// place, its copy and its 64px target - only the three accents are gone

             The beginner persona read it as the app reporting a fault with
             her PHONE, not as a heading over a control to approach slowly:
             a red warning that fires before she has touched anything is
             indistinguishable from an error message. The heading now names
             what the section DOES, and the red moves off it and stays where
             it belongs - on the .chip-btn.danger control itself, which
             test/audit-ux-fixes.test.mjs pins - so the colour warns about an
             action rather than about the app.
             The rest of the block moved to the same register. It now says
             what actually gets deleted and that clearAllData() downloads a
             backup file first (it has done that since the audit and never
             told anyone, which is the single most reassuring fact on this
             screen), and the confirm names its subject instead of asking a

      // The consequence was a permanently dead control. This tab's own banner
      // stayed up, and tapping it posted SKIP_WAITING to a worker that had
      // already activated - a no-op - and then waited for a controllerchange
      // that could never fire again, because the controller had already
      // changed once, here, silently. The banner could not be applied or
      // dismissed for the life of the tab, while the tab ran old app.js code
      // against the new worker's cache: precisely the inconsistent state the
      // "never swap out from under an active session" rule exists to avoid.
      // ONLY a genuine swap, never the first-ever claim. A page with no prior
      // controller gets one controllerchange the moment the first worker
      // claims it; treating that as "already swapped" made applyUpdate()
      // reload WITHOUT posting SKIP_WAITING, so the waiting worker never
      // activated and the reload served the old version again - caught
      // immediately by update-flow.mjs's "banner does NOT show while hidden".
