  // ---- COMM-222 onboarding sequence -----------------------------------

  // first and third class, once attendance existed to tie them to.
  const ONBOARDING_STEP_COLUMNS = { welcome: "welcomed_at", first_week: "first_week_shown_at", first_month: "first_month_shown_at", first_class: "first_class_shown_at", third_class: "third_class_shown_at" };
  // Which single step (if any) is due right now. THE ORDER, and why it is
  // safe:
  //
  //   welcome -> first_week -> first_month -> first_class -> third_class
  //
  // The first three are COMM-222, UNCHANGED - same columns, same elapsed-
  // time conditions, checked first and in the same order they always were.
  // That is what makes COMM-316's own acceptance criterion ("these two
  // steps do not block or reorder the three already-shipped steps") true
  // STRUCTURALLY rather than by convention: the two attendance checks below
  // only run once none of the three time-based steps is due, so a first or
  // third class landing early, late, or never cannot move welcome's Day-1
  // firing, first_week's 7-day firing or first_month's 30-day firing by so
  // much as a render.
  //
  // JUDGMENT CALL (the ticket names this as one, not fully specified):
  // first-class ranks below all three existing steps rather than between
  // welcome and first-week. The tempting alternative - an eager member who
  // logs a class on day one seeing "first class" before or instead of
  // "welcome" - was rejected because the single onboarding slot can only
  // show one card, and letting an attendance milestone occupy that slot
  // ahead of (or instead of) welcome/first_week would be exactly the
  // "reorder" effect the ticket's own criterion asks this file to avoid.
  // Appending the two new checks after the three, rather than interleaving
  // them, is the version where that claim can be verified by reading the
  // first three lines below and stopping - they are byte-for-byte what
  // COMM-222 shipped. first-class ranks above third-class for the obvious
  // reason: three classes cannot happen before one.
  //
  // Only one step shows at a time, the same COMM-222 shape: a later step
  // becoming due never hides an earlier one still undismissed, and
  // dismissing one lets whichever step is due next - by this same order -
  // show on the very next render.

  // it for staff - so a coach's cross-user select of it would silently
  // return nothing for every row but their own, the exact "looks like it
  // works, does nothing" failure mode 202608290013's own comments call out
  // for the Assign-coach column. profiles.created_at is used instead: it is
  // already club-wide readable (profiles_read_authenticated, 202608280003)
  // and profiles_insert_self requires a redeemed invite to already exist, so
  // it lands within the same session as redeemed_at for every real member.
  // Follow-up: either invite_redemptions gets a staff-readable SELECT
  // policy, or created_at is accepted as the canonical join date for good.
  //
  // "Sessions logged" (COMM-224): there is no readable-by-a-coach raw
  // lifetime session count anywhere in this schema (community_streaks
  // exposes a consecutive-day run, not a total; community_profile's

  //
  // WHY A SEPARATE TOP-LEVEL SECTION, NOT APPENDED INSIDE
  // renderAdminAnalyticsDashboard() THE WAY COMM-311's renderMemberSegments()
  // WAS.
  //
  // COMM-310's own shell is gated on `hasPerm(PERM.ANALYTICS_VIEW) ||
  // isAdmin()`, and every section appended inside it so far (COMM-311's
  // segments) shares exactly that gate - there was never a reason to check
  // again. COMM-313 is the first ticket in this cluster whose own gate is a
  // STRICT SUBSET of the shell's: real is_admin() alone, no
  // community.analytics.view alternative (the migration's own "THE GATE IS
  // is_admin() ALONE" header, and the ticket's own acceptance criterion,
  // "matching COMM-312's narrower bar"). A community.analytics.view holder
  // who is not an admin is meant to see the dashboard and the segments and
  // NOT this - the one negative case COMM-313 calls out as genuinely
  // different from COMM-310/311.
  //
  // Nesting this section inside renderAdminAnalyticsDashboard()'s own
  // populated branch and re-gating just this call would still be CORRECT
  // (the inner isAdmin()-only check below would still hide it from that
  // permission holder), but it would bury a narrower permission boundary
  // inside a container whose own header and period selector belong to a
  // broader one - a reviewer skimming renderAdminAnalyticsDashboard() would
  // reasonably assume everything inside it shares its gate, and the next
  // person to add a section there could copy that assumption straight into
  // a real bug. Keeping it as its own ach-section, with its own isAdmin()
  // check at the very top (the same standalone `if (!isAdmin()) return "";`
  // shape renderMemberManagement() already uses, not the OR-with-permission
  // shape), makes the boundary visible at the call site instead of implicit
  // inside a shared container. It still lives in the same admin-moderation
  // cluster, right next to the dashboard in the account tab, and it reuses
  // every rendering building block (adminAnalyticsCard/Row/RatioText,
  // sectionHead, the aria-busy skeleton shape) COMM-310 already built - nothing
  // here is a new visual language, only a new permission boundary.
  //
  // RENDERING APPROACH: reuses COMM-310's own "weeks" pattern
  // (renderAdminAnalyticsWcam/Posting: a log-list of one row per week,
  // adminAnalyticsRow(label, value)) rather than inventing a chart. Each
  // series (a cohort month, or one side of a correlation cut) is its own
  // adminAnalyticsCard with a log-list of "שבוע N: share% (מתוך n חברים)"
  // rows - a "standard retention curve" read top-to-bottom instead of drawn,
  // which is what COMM-310's own precedent already does for a single series
  // and this section does once per series. Correctness over visual polish,
  // per the ticket's own instruction for an internal admin tool.

  // POST_TEXT or POST_PHOTO - it has no "make this a POST_EVENT" switch
  // (the same class of gap the challenges cluster found and documented for
  // links.challenge_id, which post_create does not even carry a key for).
  // event_id is different: the key genuinely IS merged into metadata
  // today, so closing this gap does not need a schema change. The row
  // post_create just inserted is authored by the caller
  // (posts_insert_self requires author_id = auth.uid()), and
  // posts_update_self (202608260001) already lets that same author update
  // ANY column of their own row with no restriction - so the follow-up
  // own-row RLS update below, from the post_create defaults straight to
  // the POST_EVENT shape, is a legitimate use of an existing policy, not a
  // bypass of one. contracts.md commits this cluster to zero schema
  // change for events; this is how that commitment is kept while still
  // giving the event a real POST_EVENT card instead of a plain POST_TEXT
  // one.
  //
  // Guards against a duplicate post on a cancel -> republish -> cancel
  // round trip or a double click on Publish: looks for an existing
  // POST_EVENT row carrying this event_id before creating a second one.
  // `events` itself carries no post_id column by design (see

  // ---- Trained-with-you-today card in the feed top area (COMM-307) -----------
  // The client half of COMM-307, closing COMM-P05. The schema half shipped as
  // 202608310005; read its header and contracts.md's
  // "attendance_classmates_today(p_limit int default 6)" entry before changing
  // anything here, because three of the decisions below are only correct
  // because of what that function already guarantees.
  //
  // WHAT THIS CARD SAYS, and nothing more: these members logged a session on
  // the same day you did. No count, no streak, no time of day, no "trained 2
  // hours ago" - attendance_log records a day, not a time, and the function
  // deliberately returns four keys and no fifth. Anything more would be the
  // client inventing a claim the data does not make.
  //
  // THE OMISSION IS THE WHOLE DESIGN. An empty result renders NOTHING - no
  // heading, no empty state, no retry - which is COMM-232's "on no signal,
  // show nothing" precedent adopted by name in COMM-307's acceptance criteria.
  // The server returns an empty set in three indistinguishable cases: the
  // caller did not train today, the caller trained but nobody else did, and
  // the caller's own show_attendance is off (a direct profiles column read
  // inside the function - it is a reciprocity rule, and it is enforced there
  // rather than here because every boundary in this module is server-side).
  // Nothing in this file tries to tell those three apart. It cannot, by
  // design, and the card would look identical if it could.
  //
  // NO CLIENT-SIDE "TODAY". `current_date` is the server's UTC day, the same
  // day attendance_log's trigger compares against when it writes the row this
  // card reads. A client-side date check for "did I train today" would drift
  // from that by up to a timezone and gate the card on a different day than
  // the one that produced it, so there is no date arithmetic here at all: the
  // client calls, and renders what comes back.
  //
  // NO "MESSAGE" AFFORDANCE, per the phase's standing no-messaging
  // resolution. Direct messaging was removed from scope entirely; there is no
  // Message button anywhere in this file and this card does not add the first.
  //
  // LIMIT. 6, the function's own default, passed explicitly rather than
  // relied on: the clamp range (1..20) is the server's and is fixed, but
  // 202608310005 records that "the default inside it is the client half's to
  // revisit", so the number the card actually wants lives here, at the card.

  // Every notification type the server can send in V1. `mode` is how the
  // centre renders it: an immediate row stands alone, a batched row is one
  // collapsed group that expands. `pref` is the notification_preferences
  // key its delivery is gated on (COMM-144). `operational: true` means it
  // always lands in-app regardless of that preference. `icon` and `title`
  // are the client copy; the server fills `body` and `deep_link`.
  // `serverTitle: true` is the one exception: for an announcement the row's
  // stored title IS the announcement's own headline (notif_announcement_fanout
  // passes v_row.title), so it has to win over the generic client label.
  // Every OTHER type gets a hardcoded English string from notif_create -
  // 'Achievement unlocked', 'New comment on your post', 'Event cancelled' -
  // which is why the client label is preferred everywhere else. The
  // immediate/batched split here MUST match the server trigger set - see
  // the routing table in contracts.md.
  //
  // `pref` values below match `public.notif_pref_key()` (202608280026, as
  // amended). Three were re-keyed (COMM-218/219): `comment_reply` now reads
  // `comment_reply` (was the client-only `replies`), `comment_on_post` and
  // `comment_also` both now read `comment_on_post` (was `comments`), and
  // `achievement_unlocked` now reads `achievement_unlocked` (was
  // `achievements`) - each one made its Settings toggle actually suppress
  // delivery for the first time, since the server's identity fallback maps
  // an unmapped type to itself, not to the client's old coarse name.
  // `challenge_ending_soon`/`challenge_update` are DELIBERATELY left on the
  // shared client-only key `challenges`: the server has no arm for either
  // (each falls through to its own raw type name), so there is no single
  // server-side key a combined client toggle could honestly map to today.
  // Splitting that one toggle into two, or adding the server arms, is a
  // separate, larger change (schema coordination or a UX change) and is a
  // documented known gap, same as contracts.md already records it.
  //
  // `new_report` (202609050003) and `monthly_club_recap` (202609010002) are
  // both real server-emitted types with no `notif_pref_key` arm, so - same
  // reasoning as the three above - each MUST use its own literal type name
  // as `pref`, matching the server's identity fallback exactly.
  // `new_report` is moderators-only (`mod_alert_recipients()`: is_admin or a
  // role holding `community.comment.moderate`, owner included) - a plain
  // member is never a recipient, so its Settings row is gated to staff in
  // `renderNotifPrefsPanel()` (`staffOnly` below) rather than shown to
  // everyone as a toggle that would never do anything for them.
  // `monthly_club_recap` fans out club-wide to every member, so it gets an
  // ordinary toggle everyone sees, sibling to `weekly_recap`. It is
  // IMMEDIATE, not batched, per contracts.md: it fires at most twelve times
  // a year, at the moment a staff member deliberately publishes it, so
  // there is nothing to roll up.

  // close it, and focus returns to whatever opened it. Per-dialog Escape
  // wiring lives in the document keydown handler; this block owns focus-in,
  // the Tab trap, the backdrop, and focus restoration. Registry order is the

  // this registry now reads the flag: before namespacing it could do
  // state[key], which only worked because every dialog flag happened to be a
  // top-level sibling. A getter per entry keeps the registry the single place
